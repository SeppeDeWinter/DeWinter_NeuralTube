\section*{SUMMARY}

By encoding clusters of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, genomic enhancers act as hubs for combinatorial TF
recruitment. 
Enhancer code studies have been limited to specific cell types in model organisms. 
Here we set out to create a compendium of enhancer codes for all cell types of the developing human neural tube and neural crest. 
To this end, we generated a single-cell multiome atlas of human neural tube organoids and of the head of a four weeks post conception human embryo. 
Using DNA sequence based deep learning - DeepNeuralTube - we identify 15 cell types that are shared between the organoid 
model and the human embryo and comprehensively analyse the enhancer code of each individual cell type. 
We confirm the paradigm that enhancers are encoded using heterotypic clusters of 4-5 TF binding sites in a nucleosome depleted region, using soft syntactic rules. 
We also provide counter examples to this rule, with enhancers encoded as homotypic clusters and by dimer motifs. 
Finally, we validate DeepNeuralTube using enhancer reporter assays and assess the role of human genetic variants on 
facial mesenchyme enhancers. 
Our neural tube enhancer compendium is available as a resource at: something.aertslab.org

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

%%% INTRO TO FIELD

Genomes of complex multi-cellular organisms specify all cell types and states\cite{trapnellDefiningCellTypes2015, arendtOriginEvolutionCell2016, fleckWhatCellType2023} through distinct non-coding elements named
enhancers\cite{davidsonRegulatoryGenomeGene2010}. 
Central to the study of the genomic regulatory code is the paradigm that 
enhancers consist of heterotypic clusters of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)\cite{longEverChangingLandscapesTranscriptional2016,kimDecipheringMultiscaleQuantitative2023} with soft syntactic rules\cite{zeitlingerSevenMythsHow2020}, 
and that cooperative binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs)\cite{lambertHumanTranscriptionFactors2018} underlies cell type-specific activity of the enhancer.\par

and largely support this enhancer code paradigm. 
However, these studies have been predominantly limited to a small number of cell types or cell states\cite{
  maslovaDeepLearningImmune2020,
  minnoyeCrossspeciesAnalysisEnhancer2020,
  atakInterpretationAllelespecificChromatin2021,

  janssensDecodingGeneRegulation2022,
  heckerEnhancerdrivenCellType2025}, with only few studies profiling human development\cite{mannensChromatinAccessibilityHuman2024}.\par

Organoids are a reductionistic biological model system that can be used to interrogate how cell types are encoded in the human genome. 
They can be used to model biological systems that are otherwise - due to ethical and/or practical reasons - inaccessible for study. 
Organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells are especially interesting in this context, given that they
can be used to study how the human genome can generate multiple distinct cell types\cite{mccauleyPluripotentStemCellderived2017,takebeOrganoidsDesign2019, hoferEngineeringOrganoids2021}.\par

%%% What is missing and bridge

Current efforts are ongoing to determine the breadth of human cell types that can be generated using organoid protocols 
and how they compare to their \textit{in vivo} counterparts at a transcriptomic level\cite{
  heIntegratedTranscriptomicCell2024,
  xuIntegratedTranscriptomicCell2023}. 
However, such comparisons at the level of the enhancer code are still limited\cite{
  zenkSinglecellEpigenomicReconstruction2024,
  fleckInferringPerturbingCell2023}. 

In this study, we address these limitations by building an enhancer code compendium of cell types and cell states generated by human neural tube organoids, 
a model system for early human neural and neural crest development\cite{abdelfattahActuationEnhancesPatterning2021}.
We compare this compendium to that of the head of a four weeks post conception human embryo.
Through these comparisons we assess the enhancer code paradigm, 
and also provide counter examples specifically related to the enhancer code underlying anterior-posterior patterning.

\section*{RESULTS}

\subsection*{Human neural tube organoids recapitulate early neural and neural crest development}

We generated human neural tube organoids to model early human neural and neural crest development. 
To this end we embedded single cells from two induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines (Sigma and BJ1) and one embryonic stem cell line (ESC; H9) into separate synthetic poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) based extracellular matrices. The organoids were incubated for 11 days and we supplemented the medium with retinoic acid (RA) and Smoothened agonist (SAG) from day 3 until day 5 (\textbf{Fig. 1a}). 
These conditions were previously shown to generate multiple neural progenitor and
neural crest states\cite{abdelfattahActuationEnhancesPatterning2021}. 
To characterize the organoid-derived cell types to a greater level of detail at both transcriptomic as well as chromatin accessibility level we performed 10x single-cell multiomics (combined scATAC-seq and
scRNA-seq) 
at four time points of differentiation (day 4-5, day 6-7, day 8-9 and day 10-11; \textbf{Fig. 1a}), 
resulting in 22,862 high quality cells (\textbf{Fig. 1b}). 
Note that similar transcriptomic states were obtained from all three cell lines (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S1a-b}) demonstrating the robustness of the organoid system.\par

To evaluate the biological relevance of the cell types and states obtained from the organoid, 
we also performed 10x single cell multiomics on the head of a single four weeks post conception human embryo, 
resulting in 25,785 high quality cells (\textbf{Fig. 1c}). 
We annotated both the organoid and embryo cells based on the expression of marker genes
(\textbf{Supplementary Table S1}). 
In both systems we could identify neural progenitors, early differentiating neurons,
neural crest, facial mesenchyme and early differentiating peripheral neurons (\textbf{Fig. 1b-c}).
Additionally, in the organoid only we could identify a pluripotent stem cell population (\textbf{Fig. 1b}) 
while perivascular macrophages (PVM) / microglia (MIC) and otic placode cells were missing in the organoid system (\textbf{Fig. 1c}).\par

Next, we sub-clustered the neural progenitor, early neuron, and neural crest cells (\textbf{Fig. 1d-f}). 
Both organoid and embryo neural progenitors show a gradient of different cell states reflecting dorso-ventral patterning, evident from the expression of dorso-ventral marker TFs\cite{delasRepressiveInteractionsGene2020}:
\textit{ARX}, \textit{NKX2-2}, \textit{PAX6}, \textit{IRX3}, \textit{ZIC1} and \textit{GDF7} (\textbf{Fig. 1d}). 
In both the organoid and embryo system we obtained multiple early neural differentiation states.
This includes a cluster that expresses the neural progenitor marker \textit{SOX2}, cells that express the early neural induction marker \textit{ASCL1} and distinct clusters marked by the expression of \textit{GAD1}, \textit{UNCX} and \textit{GATA2} (\textbf{Fig. 1e}). 
Finally, focusing on the neural crest, in both the organoid and the embryo we identified a population of pre-migratory neural crest (\textit{GRHL2} expression and absence of \textit{ZEB2} expression), migratory neural crest (\textit{SOX10} and \textit{ZEB2} expression), facial mesenchyme (\textit{TWIST1} expression) and early differentiation peripheral neurons (\textit{NEUROD1} expression). 
In the embryo, but not in the organoid, we observed an additional population of cells marked by the expression of \textit{SOX10} and \textit{PAX2} reflecting the otic placode (\textbf{Fig. 1f}).\par

Next, we assessed the expression of anterior-posterior (AP) marker TFs. 
While the organoid cells had either an anterior forebrain (\textit{SIX3}) or anterior spinal cord (\textit{HOXB3}) identity, 
in the embryo we observed a gradient of anterior-to-posterior identities marked by the expression of \textit{SIX3}, \textit{EMX2}, \textit{FOXG1}, \textit{BARHL1}, \textit{EN1 }and \textit{HOXB3} (\textbf{Fig. 1g})\cite{braunComprehensiveCellAtlas2023}.\par

Scoring cells of both organoid and embryo origin for the expression of cell cylce marker genes, 
we observed that both early differentiating peripheral neurons and to a greater extent early differentiating neurons of the central nervous system are in cell cycle arrest (\textbf{Fig. 1h}), an important hallmark of neural differentiating\cite{
braunComprehensiveCellAtlas2023}, while other cell types are still in different phases of the cell cycle (\textbf{Fig. 1h})\par

Finally, to assess whether the organoid-derived cell types and states are also similar to the embryo at the level of chromatin accessibility
we identified sets of co-accessible regions in the organoid model using topic modeling 
and identified equivalent cells in the embryo where the same regions were also co-accessible.
We observed similar patterns of marker gene expression for the same cell state across the organoid and embryo (\textbf{Fig. 1i}) 
with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83 across matched states (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S1c-d}).\par

\subsection*{
  DeepNeuralTube: sequence-to-function models that reveal the enhancer code underlying early neural and neural crest 
  development
}

To gain insight into the sequence characteristics underlying cell type-specific chromatin accessibility of 
neural progenitor, neural crest and neural cell type-specific enhancers, 
we trained two sequence-to-function model convolutional neural networks:
"$DeepNeuralTube^o$" and "$DeepNeuralTube^e$", on the organoid and embryo atlases respectively. 
The models use the DNA sequence of genomic regions as input and classify regions based on their cell type- or state-specific chromatin accessibility (in a multi-label multi-class fashion; \textbf{Fig. 2a}). 
The classes of the models are defined as the topics from topic modeling. 
To get a fine-grained definition of cell states, we performed topic modeling separately for the subset of neural progenitors, neural crest (incl. facial mesenchyme and peripheral neurons) and early differentiating neurons for both organoid (to train $DeepNeuralTube^o$) and embryo (to train $DeepNeuralTube^e$).\par

We tested the performance of $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ to predict cell type-specific enhancer activity 
using data from the VISTA enhancer browser\cite{viselVISTAEnhancerBrowsera2007, kosickiVISTAEnhancerBrowser2025}.
Enhancers active in the neural tube (n=349) could be classified with an area under the receiver-operator curve
(auROC) of 0.75 and 0.80 using resp. $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ (\textbf{Fig. 2b}; and
area under the precision-recall curve (auPR) of 0.21 resp. 0.29 (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S2a-b})). 
Enhancers active in the facial mesenchyme (n=143) could be classified with an auROC of 0.78 and 0.79 
using resp. $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ (\textbf{Fig. 2c}; 
and auPR of 0.17 for both models (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S2a-b})). 
Of note, a fraction of neural tube enhancers (\SI{24}{\percent}) are predicted to be specific to pre-migratory neural crest by
both models. Given that the VISTA enhancers are annotated based on localization of enhancer activity only, and given
that it is difficult to visually distinguish between the neural tube and pre-migratory neural crest, this result 
is not surprising.\par

Next, we assessed the explainability of the models. Concretely we tested if the model learned known
TF binding motifs as features. To this end, we calculated pairwise similarities\cite{
  guptaQuantifyingSimilarityMotifs2007} between \textit{de novo} motifs learned by the model, 
and identified using TF-MoDISco\cite{shrikumarTechnicalNoteTranscription2018}, and known motifs that are enriched in cell type specific regions.
Clustering this pairwise similarity matrix resulted in 56 clusters (\textbf{Fig. 2d}). 
All clusters, except cluster 47 (organoid specific CG motif), contain known motifs enriched in regions specific to both 
organoid and embryo cell types (\textbf{Fig. 2e} and \textbf{Supplementary Table S2}).
More importantly, most clusters (\SI{70}{\percent}) contain at least one motif learned \textit{de novo} by the organoid and/or embryo model (\textbf{Fig. 2f-g} and \textbf{Supplementary Table S2}). 
Thus, $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ use known-motifs as features to classify regions based
on cell type-specific chromatin accessibility.\par

As an illustrative example, we investigated an enhancer located in one of the introns of \textit{GLI3} (hs111.0; \textbf{Supplementary Fig. S2c}). 
This region has neural tube specific activity in E11.5 mouse embryos (\textbf{Fig. 2h}). 
Both $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ explain this region similarly (Pearson correlation of 0.79) 
and highlight the importance of multiple SOX TFBS (\textbf{Fig. 2h}). 
A version of this enhancer where 5\% of the nucleotides are changed (hs111.1) does not have neural tube specific enhancer activity and both models predict that this loss of activity is due to the loss of a single SOX TFBS (\textbf{Fig. 2h}).\par

Finally, to also investigate the performance of the models on migratory neural crest, 
a cell type for which there are no validated enhancers in the VISTA enhancer browser, 
we selected a genomic region that is specifically accessible in the migratory neural crest (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S2d}). 
Both models predict this region to be specific to the migratory neural crest class (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S2e})
and nucleotide importance scores reveal TFBS for a SOX monomer, a SOX dimer and AP2 (\textbf{Fig. 2i}). 
Next, we tested the enhancer activity of this region using an enhancer-reporter assay in chicken embryos. 
Indeed the enhancer was specifically active in migratory neural crest 24 hours after injection in an HH4 embryo (\textbf{Fig. 2i}).\par

\subsection*{
  The enhancer code underlying dorso-ventral patterning of neural progenitors
}

Focusing on neural progenitors, we identified topics representing cells and regions of different dorso-ventral
identities in both the organoid and the embryo data (\textbf{Fig. 3a}). 
From ventral to dorsal this is topic 36, 38, 33, 54 and 48 for the organoids and
topic 34, 38, 79, 88 and 58 for the embryo. 
As an example we first investigated two enhancers of \textit{SHH} that are strongly conserved and specific to the 
floorplate: SFPE1 and SFPE2\cite{jeongDistinctRegulatorsShh2003}. 
\textit{SHH} is most strongly expressed in the most ventral topic (33 and 34 resp. for the organoids and the embryo; \textbf{Fig. 3b}).
SFPE1 is located upstream of \textit{SHH} and SFPE2 in its second intron. Both enhancers are indeed most accessible in the cells belonging to the ventral topic (\textbf{Fig. 3c}). 
When we tested the enhancer activity of SFPE1 in chicken embryos we could confirm its floor plate specific activity
(\textbf{Fig. 3d}).
Explaining the accessibility of both enhancers using DeepNeuralTube reveals two FOX (one partial) and two RFX (one partial) binding sites in SFPE1 and two FOX, a ZEB and a TEAD binding site in SFPE2 (\textbf{Fig. 3e}).\par

To investigate the enhancer code underlying dorso-ventral patterning of neural progenitors further, we clustered 
and aligned \textit{de novo} motifs, identified in dorso-ventral regions, based on pairwise motif similarities. 
Next, we calculated the average contribution for all identified motif instances per cluster and for each topic 
resulting in a dorso-ventral enhancer code-table (\textbf{Fig. 3f}).
Both $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ found similar patterns underlying the dorso-ventral states and the 
importance of the instances of these patterns is highly correlated across both models (0.75 average Pearson correlation; \textbf{Fig. 3f}). 
For the most ventral state (organoid topic 33 and embryo topic 34) a combination of FOX, TEAD and RFX instances 
are important (\textbf{Fig. 3f-g}) and the importance of these instances correlates with the expression of respectively \textit{FOXA1/A2/P2/P4}, \textit{TEAD1} and \textit{RFX3/4} in both the organoid and embryo (\textbf{Fig. 3h} and Supplementary Fig. S3). 
In subsequent more dorsal neural progenitor domains we observe importance of NKX instances, correlating with \textit{NKX2-1/2} expression (\textbf{(Fig. 3f-h)}); 
PAX instances, correlating with \textit{PAX3/6} expression (\textbf{Fig. 3f-h} and Supplementary Fig. S3) and 
ZIC instances, correlating with \textit{ZIC1} expression (\textbf{Fig. 3f-h} and Supplementary Fig. S3). 
For all dorso-ventral progenitor domains, except the most ventral one (and the most dorsal one in the embryo), 
SOX instances are important correlating with the expression of \textit{SOX2/3} (\textbf{Fig. 3f-h} and Supplementary Fig. S3). 
Similarly, ZEB instances have a negative importance to the accessibility of regions in dorso-ventral domains except the most ventral one (\textbf{Fig. 3f} and Supplementary Fig. S3). 
Finally, we calculated the Jaccard index of genomic regions based on the presence of instances of each identified pattern to investigate which patterns often co-occur in the same regions (\textbf{Fig. 3i}). 
FOX, TEAD and RFX instances often co-occur in the same genomic region while instances of other patterns tend to be present in separate regions (\textbf{Fig. 3i}).\par

To assess the ability of DeepNeuralTube for prioritizing enhancer with cell type-specific activity we selected a genomic
region that was predicited to be specific for ventral neural progenitors (\textbf{Fig. 3k}). Explaining this region,
reveals multiple FOX instances and a SOX instance by both $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ (\textbf{Fig. 3j}). 
Finally, we tested the activity of this region in chicken embryos, revealing that it indeed is specifically active in
the floorplate of the neural tube (\textbf{Fig. 3l}).\par

It has been reported that FOXA1/2 is a pioneer factor\cite{iwafuchi-doiPioneerTranscriptionFactor2016, iwafuchiGeneNetworkTransitions2020}. 
Indeed, when centering on FOX instances we observe a strong Tn5 cut-site footprint (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S4a}). 
We then asked if there is any difference between regions that are generally bound by FOXA2 in any cell state that expresses this TF and regions, bound by FOXA2, that are specific to the floorplate. 
For this purpose, we intersected FOXA2 ChIP-seq peaks in HepG2 and A549  with floorplate peaks containing FOX instances. 
We classified the regions that overlap with any of the ChIP-seq datasets as regions that are generally bound by FOXA2 and those that did not as floorplate specific. Quantifying both the number of FOX instances per region and 
the affinity of each individual instance (making use of the FOX motif score calculated using
FIMO\cite{grantFIMOScanningOccurrences2011, schreiberTangermemeBiologicalSequence2025}) reveals that floorplate 
specific FOXA2 target regions have fewer FOX instances compared to general FOXA2 target regions (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S4b}). 
Furthermore, individual FOX instances in general FOXA2 target regions have higher affinity compared to FOX instances in
specific regions (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S4c}). These results suggest that the overall affinity of general FOXA2 target regions 
is higher (either by having a greater number of binding sites or by having binding sites with higher affinity).

\subsection*{
  Homotypic clusters of distinct homeodomain transcription factor binding sites encode anterior-posterior patterning
}

In the embryo we identified seven topics corresponding to different AP domains, from anterior to posterior this is Topic 61, Topic 59, Topic 31, Topic 62, Topic 70, Topic 52 and Topic 71 (\textbf{Fig. 4a}). 
We first asked if the AP-program is distinct from the DV program. 
In other words, is AP patterning encoded in the same or in different genomic regions as DV patterning? 
For this purpose, we calculated the pairwise correlation between region-topic probabilities of all AP and DV topics (\textbf{Fig. 4b}). 
This revealed that both AP and DV patterning are mostly encoded in distinct genomic regions, 
with the exception of AP Topic 59 and 31 that correlate with the region-topic probability of DV Topic 38 
(which corresponds to cells expressing \textit{NKX2-1/2}; \textbf{Fig. 4b})\par

$DeepNeuralTube^e$ was able to distinguish the different AP domains but grouped topics of similar domains
% TODO: S.A.: How does the organoid model score all these AP topics?
together (i.e., Topic 59, 31 and 62; Topic 52 and 71), resulting in four distinct AP domains (\textbf{Fig.4 c-d}) and 
for this it made use of four distinct homeodomain TF binding motifs, one for each domain (\textbf{Fig. 4e}). 
From anterior to posterior this is \textit{TAATTA}, \textit{GGATTA}, \textit{TCATGWTGANTGA} and \textit{CATYMATCA}.
Notably, the patterns corresponding to the two posterior most topics correspond to homeobox dimer-motifs. 
Previously it had been hypothesized that genome-wide specific binding of homeodomain TFs is accomplished through
cooperative binding of two TFs\cite{mannChapter3Hox2009}. 
Indeed, the presence of instances of the \textit{TCATGWTGANTGA} motif correlates with the expression of both \textit{PAX5/8} and \textit{EN1/2} 
and the prescence of instances of the \textit{CATYMATCA} motif correlates with the expression of \textit{MEIS1/2}, \textit{PBX1/2} and \textit{HOXB3} (\textbf{Fig. 4d-e} and Supplementary Fig. S5). 
In contrast, patterns corresponding to the two anterior most topics correspond to monomer motifs, 
correlating with the expression of \textit{LHX2/9}, \textit{RAX} and \textit{SIX3/6} for the most anterior topic and 
with the expression of \textit{OTX1/2}, \textit{EMX2}, \textit{DMBX1} and \textit{LMX1A} for the second most anterior
topic (\textbf{Fig. 4d-e} and Supplementary Fig. S5)\par
%TODO: I'm surprised to see EMX2 (forebrain) together with OTX1/2 and DMBX1 (midbrain)

Focusing on the two most anterior domains, two similar homeodomain TF binding motifs seem to underlie the differential
accessibility of those domains. Both have the core homeobox motif "\textit{TAAT}" 
but one is flanked by the nucleotides \textit{TAG} while the other is flanked by the nucleotides \textit{CCCT}. 
%TODO: Do we know which TFs these correspond to? If you do, mention it in the text
We were surprised that this slight difference in the two motifs would be enough for encoding two separate AP domains.
To test this hypothesis, we first performed a substitution experiment where we replaced all instances of
\textit{CTAAT\underline{TAG}} with \textit{CTAAT\underline{CCCT}} in regions of the most anterior domain and vice
versa (\textbf{Fig. 4f}). 
Indeed, $DeepNeuralTube^e$ predicts an anterior-to-posterior shift of accessibility of those regions after the \textit{CTAAT\underline{TAG}} to \textit{CTAAT\underline{CCCT}} substitution and 
vice versa a posterior-to-anterior shift of accessibility after the \textit{CTAAT\underline{CCCT}} to
\textit{CTAAT\underline{TAG}} substitution (\textbf{Fig. 4f}). 
Next, we designed enhancers from scratch by embedding either the \textit{CTAAT\underline{TAG}} or 
\textit{CTAAT\underline{CCCT}} motif\cite{taskiranCelltypedirectedDesignSynthetic2024, kempynckCREstedModelingGenomic2025} 
and using respectively Topic 61 and Topic 31 as target class (\textbf{Fig. 4g}). 
Embedding of two instances of either motif was sufficient to reach predicted chromatin accessibility levels of equivalent ranges to the predicted chromatin accessibility levels of genomic regions (\textbf{Fig. 4g}). 
Next, to eliminate potential model bias we repeated the same experiment but optimized for the opposite class. 
This is, we optimized for Topic 31 by embedding the \textit{CTAAT\underline{TAG}} motif and we optimized for Topic 61
by embedding the \textit{CTAAT\underline{CCCT}} motif (\textbf{Fig. 4h}). 
In this case, the synthetic design failed to converge for the target class but instead regions with high prediction 
score for the AP domain that corresponds to the motif used for embedding were generated. 
In other words, embedding of the \textit{CTAAT\underline{TAG}} motif still generated regions with high prediction score for Topic 61 
and embedding of the \textit{CTAAT\underline{CCCT}} motif generated regions with high prediction score for Topic 31 (\textbf{Fig. 4h}), even though the prediction score was optimized towards the opposite class.\par

These results suggest that an unsophisticated, homotypic code using two distinct motifs is sufficient to distinguish between the two utmost neural progenitor AP domains. 
Encouraged by this finding, we trained a logistic regression model to classify genomic regions of those two domains 
in either Topic 61 or Topic 31 using as features only the motif scores of the two motifs identified above (\textbf{Fig. 4i}). 
Surprisingly, this very simple classifier reached high performance with area under the ROC of 0.82 and area under the precision recall curve of 0.80 (\textbf{Fig. 4i}).\par

\subsection*{
  The enhancer code underlying pre-migratory and migratory neural crest and facial mesenchyme.
}

Focusing on neural crest cells, we identified topics representing cells and regions of both pre- and migratory neural
crest as well as facial mesenchyme (\textbf{Fig. 5a}). Similar to the neural progenitors, we used
$DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ to generate a neural crest code-table (\textbf{Fig. 5b}). 
Again, both $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ found similar patterns and the importance of the instances of
these patterns is highly correlated across both models (0.73 average Pearson correlation coefficient; \textbf{Fig. 5b}).\par

Organoid Topic 62 and embryo Topic 103 represent the pre-migratory neural crest state and 
instances of TEAD, GRHL, AP2 and ZEB patterns are important for this state (\textbf{Fig. 5b-c}) 
the importance of TEAD instances correlates with \textit{TEAD3/4} expression, 
GRHL with \textit{GRHL1/1} 
and AP2 with both \textit{TFAP2A} and \textit{TFAP2C} (\textbf{Fig. 5d} and Supplementary Fig. S6). 
Note that ZEB instances have a positive contribution to the pre-migratory while it has a 
negative contribution to all other neural crest states (\textbf{Fig. 5b-c}); 
and moreover a negative contribution to all other cell states of both the neural progenitors (\textbf{Fig. 3e}) and neurons (\textbf{Fig. 6b}). 
The positive contribution of ZEB in the pre-migratory neural crest state coincides with the absence of the expression of both \textit{ZEB1} and \textit{ZEB2} (\textbf{Fig. 5d} and Supplementary Fig. S6). 
This is in line with the previously reported role of ZEB2 as a chromatin closing repressor \cite{taskiranCelltypedirectedDesignSynthetic2024}.\par

The migratory neural crest cell state is represented by two organoid topics (Topic 65 and 59) and a single embryo topic (Topic 94). 
Nuclear receptor, AP2, ZIC (only in organoid topics) and SOX-dimer (organoid Topic 59 but not 65) are important for this state (\textbf{Fig. 5b-c}). 
We could not link the nuclear receptor instances to a specific TF based on the correlation of expression and the importance score of these instances. 
The importance of AP2 instances correlates with the expression of \textit{TFAP2A}, \textit{TFAP2B} and \textit{TFAP2C} (\textbf{Fig. 5d}), 
ZIC with \textit{ZIC1} to \textit{ZIC5} and 
the SOX-dimer with expression of \textit{SOX10} (\textbf{Fig. 5d} and Supplementary Fig. S6). 
The switch from TFAP2A/C in pre-migratory neural crest to TFAP2A/B in migratory neural crest is consistent with a previously reported function of both heterodimers in respectively neural plate border induction and neural crest specification\cite{rothsteinHeterodimerizationTFAP2Pioneer2020}. 
After the pre-migratory and before the migratory neural crest state another topic is found in both organoid (Topic 60) and embryo (Topic 105) 
for which instances of RFX are important (\textbf{Fig. 5b-c}) correlating with the expression of \textit{RFX3/4} (\textbf{Fig. 5d} and Supplementary Fig. S6).\par

Finally, the facial mesenchyme cell state is represented by organoid Topic 58 and embryo Topic 91. 
Instances of a FOX patterns and a dimer consisting of a homeobox and ebox motif are important for this state (\textbf{Fig. 5b}). 
The importance of the FOX instances correlates with the expression of \textit{FOXC2/D1/P1/P2} and 
that of the dimer motif with the expression of both \textit{TWIST1} and \textit{ALX1/4} and \textit{PRRX1} (\textbf{Fig. 5d} and Supplementary Fig. S6). 
The latter is consistent with a recent study where it has been shown that TWIST1 and homeodomain TFs cooperatively
bind this specific dimer motif regulating the expression of genes involved in
facial mesenchyme\cite{kimDNAguidedTranscriptionFactor2024}.\par

Next, we investigated which patterns co-occur in the same genomic regions. For this purpose, we calculated the Jaccard
index of genomic regions based on the presence of an instance of each identified pattern (\textbf{Fig. 5e}). Using this
method we found three sets of regions that are predicted to contain instances of different sets of TFs. One set where
instances of TEAD, GRHL and ZEB co-occur, one where instances of Nuclear Receptor, AP2 and ZIC
instances co-occur, and one set where instances of FOX and TWIST1/homeodomain co-occur.\par
%TODO: C.M.: Mesenchyme+NC or calculated over all regions?

Recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) identified 203 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that are associated with facial variation\cite{whiteInsightsGeneticArchitecture2021}. 
Given that regions surrounding these SNPs were enriched for enhancer activity in cranial neural crest cells\cite{whiteInsightsGeneticArchitecture2021} 
we asked if, using $DeepNeuralTube$, we could explain the effect of some of these variants on enhancer activity. For all suggestive SNPs we scored both the reference and alternative allele(s) using both $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and $DeepNeuralTube^e$ 
and calculated the difference in prediction score between both alleles (delta prediction score). 
At an absolute delta prediction score threshold of 0.2 we identified 235 SNPs that are explainable by either of the two models. 
Note that only very few (1 out of 203) of these "explainable" SNPs overlap with the 203 lead SNPs identified by White \textit{et al.} (\textbf{Fig. 5f}). 
Most of the "explainable" SNPs have a high delta prediction score for either organoid neural crest Topic 58 or Topic 59 (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S7}). 
As an example we show the explanation of rs1555067 that is located upstream of \textit{PRRX1}. 
The G \textgreater A substitution of this SNP causes a delta prediction score of 0.64 for organoid Topic 58
(\textbf{Fig. 5g}), increasing the predicted chromatin accessibility of this genomic region in the facial mesenchyme. 
This predicted increase in chromatin accessibility is caused by generating an EBOX site 6bp downstream of a partial
homeobox site potentially creating a new binding site for TWIST1-homeodomain TF dimer (\textbf{Fig. 5h}).\par

\subsection*{
  The enhancer code underlying early neural differentiation.
}

During early neural differentiation, we identified several topics for different stages of neural fate
acquisition in both organoid and embryo cells (\textbf{Fig. 6a}). Again we made use of $DeepNeuralTube^o$ and
$DeepNeuralTube^e$ to generate a neuron code-table (\textbf{Fig. 6b}). 
Both models found similar patterns and the importance of the instances of these patterns is correlated across
both models (0.47 average Pearson correlation coefficient; \textbf{Fig. 6b}).\par

For both the organoid and embryo we found two topics (organoid Topic 6 and 4 and embryo Topic 10 and 18) for which
instances of patterns from neural progenitors are important (\textbf{Fig. 6b-c}).
These include instances of TEAD, FOX and RFX (\textbf{Fig. 6b-c}) 
correlating with the expression of respectively \textit{TEAD1},
\textit{FOXA2/J3/O1/P1/P2/P4} and \textit{RFX3/4} (\textbf{Fig. 6d} and Supplementary Fig. S8). 
Instances of a SOX monomer motif is important for one of these topics (\textbf{Fig. 6b-c}), 
correlating with the expression of \textit{SOX2} (\textbf{Fig. 6d} and Supplementary Fig. S8). 
Next, in both organoids and embryo cells we identified a topic for which both instances of neural progenitor 
patterns as well as an EBOX pattern is important (organoid Topic 23 and embryo Topic 13 \textbf{Fig. 6b-c}). 
The importance of this EBOX pattern correlates with the expression of \textit{ASCL1} and \textit{NEUROD4}. 
For subsequent topics SOX instances are not important anymore (\textbf{Fig. 6b-c}); 
instead we find topics where a combination of EBOX and EBF instances are important 
(organoid and embryo Topic 24; \textbf{Fig. 6b-c}) the latter correlating with the expression of \textit{EBF1-3}
(\textbf{Fig. 6d} and Supplementary Fig. S8) 
and topics where a combination of EBF and ONECUT instances are important 
(organoid Topic 13 and embryo Topic 18; \textbf{Fig. 6b-c}), 
the latter correlating with the expression of \textit{ONECUT1-3}. 
Additionally, in the embryo we found topics where instances of NKX are important. 
The importance of these instances is anti-correlated with the expression \textit{NKX2-2} 
and correlated with the expression of \textit{ISL1} (\textbf{Fig. 6d} and Supplementary Fig. S8). 
Finally, in the organoids we could identify an additional topic with instances of GATA
(\textbf{Fig. 6b-c}), correlating with the expression of \textit{GATA2} (\textbf{Fig. 6d} and Supplementary Fig. S8).\par
%TODO: C.M.: NKX2-2 is an important patterning factor in the neural tube, specifically for ventralization so it should only be expressed around the floor plate. That you don't see it in the organoid might indicate that part of this patterning is not present. https://www.nature.com/articles/19315
%TODO: S.D.W.: I do see it in the DV patterning part, just not in the subset of differentiating neurons.
%TODO: C.M.: That's interesting, so in the organoid it doesn't seem to persist into neuronal differentiation while the embryo retains that NKX2.2 DV patterning? Are all the same types of neurons there or might it be related to a missing cell type?

Next, we analyzed the co-occurence of the identified patterns by calculating the Jaccard index of regions based on the presence of instances of each pattern. We find that instances of neural progenitor patterns tend to co-occur the most (\textbf{Fig. 6e}), in line with our results in figure 3.\par

\subsection* {
  Extracting general rules from the enhancer compendium
}

Summarizing our results, we identified a total of sixteen and fifteen distinct cell states in 
respectively the neural tube organoids and the head of a four weeks post conception human embryo with 
almost one-to-one correspondence based on TFBS importances and TF expression. 
Additionally, we identified 4 distinct cell states corresponding to AP patterning of the neural progenitors 
in the embryo. To get insight into the minimal set of TFBS that are needed to encode these cell states we trained
logistic regression models to classify genomic regions as belonging to the topic representing each state or not,
making use of the motif scores of the identified patterns from each code table (\textbf{Fig. 3e}, \textbf{Fig. 4e}, \textbf{Fig. 5b} and \textbf{Fig. 6b}). We used regions of the topic of interest as foreground and regions of the other topics of the same cell type-class as background.
The overall performance of these models was acceptably high (\textbf{Fig. 7a}) with an average auROC of 0.77 
and average auPR of 0.39. 
Notably, all models for neural crest related states performed best (\textbf{Fig. 7a}). 
However, the genome wide precision and recall of these models to identify topic regions is still low (Supplementary Fig. S9). \par

Next, for each cell state, we selected TFBS that had a positive coefficient for at least one of the logistic regression models 
resulting in a total of twenty one TFBS for fifteen to sixteen states plus the additional four AP states (\textbf{Fig. 7a}). 
We used the identified TFBS to design synthetic enhancers for each state using motif embedding\cite{taskiranCelltypedirectedDesignSynthetic2024, kempynckCREstedModelingGenomic2025}. 
The resulting synthetic DNA sequences had an overall high prediction score (average 0.75 and 0.23 standard deviation) (\textbf{Fig. 7a}) - 
and were cell type specific (\textbf{Fig. 7b}) - with the prediction score for neural crest related states being again the highest. 
Note that some TFBS like FOX and SOX are used by many cell states (\textbf{Fig. 7a}) while other are more specific to certain states. \par

These results indicate that enhancers specific to DV-patterning, neural crest states and early neural differentiation are encoded in the human genome using around four to five distinct TFBS (\textbf{Fig. 7a}) 
in regions of on average 134 - 154 bp in size (\textbf{Fig. 7c}), 
corresponding to the size of one nucleosome depleted region (NDR). 
AP-patterning enhancers seem to be an exception to this rule, as they are encoded by multiple instances of only two and sometimes even a single TFBS (\textbf{Fig. 7a}).

%TODO: number panels, in A middle, move legend so that text/lines do not class with guiding lines. Color for progenitor and neural crest are very similar and difficult to distinguish. I sometimes use this website to pick colors that are also colorblind friendly. https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Accent&n=4

\section*{DISCUSSION}

%%% The discussion should explain the significance of the results and place them into a broader context.
%%% Subheadings are permitted.

We built a compendium of enhancer codes underlying early human neural and neural crest development. 
Providing enhancer codes of neural progenitor DV- and AP-patterning, 
early neural fate acquisition and 
neural crest induction, migration and facial mesenchyme specification.\par

To create this compendium, we generated a single-cell multiome (combined scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq of the same cell) 
dataset of the head of a four weeks post conception human embryo and we showed that the embryonic cell states can 
effectively be reproduced using human neural tube organoids on both transcriptomic level and on the level of the 
enhancer codes. Specifically, we identified a total of fifteen distinct cell states with one-to-one matches between 
the organoid and embryo. The fact that cell states were defined in a data driven manner by making use of topic 
modeling and that each of these states were independently identified in two separate datasets increases the confidence 
of their biological relevance. Furthermore, this high similarity between the organoid and the embyro derived cell 
states validates neural tube organoids as a biological model for early human neural tube and neural crest development, 
biological cell states that are otherwise not easily accessible in humans.\par

The enhancer code remains complicated to study\cite{wassermanAppliedBioinformaticsIdentification2004} especially
compared to the genetic code\cite{kimDecipheringMultiscaleQuantitative2023, deboerHoldOutGenome2024}. 
Nonetheless, there are recurrent patterns that are shared among enhancers of different cell types. 
In particular, enhancers underlying DV patterning, early neural fate acquisition and neural crest 
tend to consist of heterotypic clusters of 4-5 different TFBS\cite{kimDecipheringMultiscaleQuantitative2023, longEverChangingLandscapesTranscriptional2016} that are located within one NDR (+/-147bp). 
That is to say, cooperative binding of multiple TFs underlies the cell type specificity of enhancers\cite{lambertHumanTranscriptionFactors2018}. 
Here, we see most evidence for a model of indirect cooperativity\cite{longEverChangingLandscapesTranscriptional2016} (i.e., flexible billboard enhancer model\cite{arnostiTranscriptionalEnhancersIntelligent2005}). 
However, for multiple cell types we also observed evidence of direct coooperativity between TFs in the form of protein-protein interactions between two TFs. 
This was the case for TWIST1 and homeodomain TFs heterodimers in facial mesenchyme\cite{kimDNAguidedTranscriptionFactor2024} 
and GRHL1/2 dimers, 
TFAP2A and TFAP2B/C heterodimers\cite{rothsteinHeterodimerizationTFAP2Pioneer2020} 
and SOX10 homodimers in neural crest. 
For all these TFs we found dimer motifs with a fixed number of nucleotides in between the two TFBS instances. 
Of note, for SOX10 we observed three different dimer motif with either 3, 4 or 5 bp spacing,
with instances with 4 bp spacing being the most accessible (\textbf{Supplementary Fig. 10}). 
Finally, we also observed evidence of pioneer activity, where binding of one TF can facilitate the 
subsequent binding of other TFs to the same enhancer\cite{longEverChangingLandscapesTranscriptional2016}. 
This was the case for FOXA2 in the floorplate, consistent with previous findings of FOXA TFs\cite{iwafuchi-doiPioneerTranscriptionFactor2016, iwafuchiGeneNetworkTransitions2020}. 
Others have hypothesized, however, that pioneer activity is not a qualitative feature of a TF but rather 
dependent on the affinity of interactions between TF and DNA\cite{hansenTestPioneerFactor2022}. 
Similarly, we observed that enhancers that are specific to the floorplate contain either less FOXA2 binding sites 
and/or binding sites of lower affinity. 
The use of suboptimal TFBS is a reoccurring feature of cell type-specific enhancers\cite{farleySuboptimizationDevelopmentalEnhancers2015, crockerChapterTwentySevenSoft2016, limAffinityoptimizingEnhancerVariants2024, naqviTransferLearningReveals2025}.\par
%TODO: S.A.: But retain strongest footprint ?!
Our results indicate that enhancers underlying neural progenitor AP-patterning form an exception to the rule 
that enhancers consist of clusters of 4-5 different TFBS. 
Homotypic clusters of 3-4 homeobox instances were sufficient to both create and identify enhancers specific to a certain AP domain. 
Similar findings were already reported in fly\cite{crockerLowAffinityBinding2015}. 
It has been a long standing question how homeodomain TFs achieve specific binding\cite{mannChapter3Hox2009, hubertHoxGenesDevelopment2023} 
given that all homeodomain TFs seem to bind the same \textit{TAAT} motif\cite{bergerVariationHomeodomainDNA2008, noyesAnalysisHomeodomainSpecificities2008}. 
It has been hypothesized that specificity is mainly achieved through cooperative binding with other TFs\cite{mannChapter3Hox2009}. 
Indeed, we observe this for EN1/2 and HOXB3 that are predicted to co-bind with PAX5/8 and MEIS1/2 or PBX1/3 respectively forming specific dimer motifs.
In contrast, we suggest a novel mode where specificity is achieved through the homeodomain itself for respectively LHX2/9, RAX or SIX3/6 and OTX1/2, EMX2, DMBX1 or LMX1A 
that preferentially bind \textit{TAATTA} and \textit{TAATCC} sites. 
Thus, additional nucleotides, next to the core \textit{TAAT}, form a TFBS that is both necessary and sufficient for genome wide cell type specificity. 
In general, although there are only around 100 different DNA binding domains across human TFs\cite{lambertHumanTranscriptionFactors2018} 
and thus many of the 1,639 known human TFs recognize similar motifs\cite{lambertHumanTranscriptionFactors2018} 
there are slight variations in preferential TFBS of TFs of the same family\cite{lambertHumanTranscriptionFactors2018, jolmaDNABindingSpecificitiesHuman2013, dealmeidaDeepSTARRPredictsEnhancer2022} 
that could be important for cell type specific binding.\par

In conclusion, we provide an enhancer code compendium of early human neural and neural crest development. 
We confirm the paradigm that enhancers consist out of heterotypic clusters of TFBS with soft syntactic rules 
but also provide a counter example to this paradigm. 
Furthermore, we validate the biological relevance of neural tube organoids. 
Finally, we provide $DeepNeuralTubes$, two sequence-to-chromatin accessibility models, 
freely available to the research community, 
which can be used to predict, 
interpret and design enhancers underlying early human neural and neural crest development.

\subsection*{Limitations of the study}

%%% A "limitations" or "limitations of the study" subsection in the discussion is encouraged and may be required for some
%%% journals and some article formats.

In this study we focused on predicting TF binding to enhancers, but not so much on their effector function. 
The effect a TF has on target gene expression depends on its effector domain and interactions with
co-factors\cite{lambertHumanTranscriptionFactors2018} and this may depend on the sequence context of
the enhancer itself\cite{jacobsWidespreadRegulatorySpecificities2023}. 
Large scales studies, in a variety of cell states, are now being performed to map TFs to co-factors and downstream effects on gene expression\cite{
  tyckoHighThroughputDiscoveryCharacterization2020, alerasoolIdentificationFunctionalCharacterization2022,
sotoCompendiumHumanTranscription2022, delrossoLargescaleMappingMutagenesis2023,
mukundHighthroughputFunctionalCharacterization2023, bellComparativeCofactorScreens2024,
tyckoDevelopmentCompactTranscriptional2024, doughtySinglemoleculeStatesLink2024}. 
These studies may especially be important to infer repressive roles of TFs on gene expression, 
an effect that is currently difficult to study with state of the art methods\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023, kempynckCREstedModelingGenomic2025,
dewinterModellingDesignTranscriptional2025}. 
In particular for the neural tube, it is known that repressive interactions in its core GRN are important\cite{delasRepressiveInteractionsGene2020}. 
In this study we could only predict a strong repressive effect of ZEB2, a chromatin closing repressor that is used across a variety of biological
systems\cite{minnoyeCrossspeciesAnalysisEnhancer2020, taskiranCelltypedirectedDesignSynthetic2024}
(\textbf{Supplementary Fig. S11}).\par

Furthermore, the expression of a gene is in general regulated by multiple enhancers in the gene's locus\cite{
  perryShadowEnhancersFoster2010,
martinez-araSystematicAnalysisIntrinsic2022, bergmanCompatibilityRulesHuman2022, zuinNonlinearControlTranscription2022,
gschwindEncyclopediaEnhancergeneRegulatory2023, martinez-araLargescaleAnalysisIntegration2024,
loubiereDevelopmentalHousekeepingTranscriptional2024, thomasEnhancerCooperativityCan2025}.
In this study we focused on the enhancer code of individual enhancers 
but not how the signal of multiple enhancers is integrated to control target gene expression. 
Currently efforts are ongoing to build large scale models for modeling gene expression making use of the
code of all enhancers in the gene's locus\cite{avsecEffectiveGeneExpression2021,linderPredictingRNAseqCoverage2025a,
hingerlScoobyModelingMultimodal2024, hingerlFlashzoiEnhancedBorzoi2024, lalDecodingSequenceDeterminants2025}.\par

To conclude, we suspect that future models will need to take into account both the effector function of TFs through
modeling co-factor interactions and the entire gene's locus (including all enhancers and promoter(s)) to effectively
model GRNs underlying the cell's transcriptome.

\subsubsection*{Collection of human fetal samples}

The experiments on human embryos in this study fall under category 2 as defined by the International Society for Stem
Cell Research (ISSCR) 2021 guidelines. All experiments followed relevant guidelines and regulations, including the ISSCR
2021 guidelines. Human fetal samples were collected from routine termination of pregnancies at the Karolinska University Hospital following informed consent of the donors. The donors were informed of the purpose of the research and specific procedures the tissues will be used for. The use of fetal samples collected from abortions was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority and the National Board of Health and Welfare (Etikprövningsmyndigheten; DNR2020-02074). Embryos were not kept in culture and were immediately dissected after collection. The embryo was staged according to the Carnegie stages. Following the dissection, the samples were transferred to ice-cold Hibernate E medium (ThermoFisher, A1247601) and processed the same day.

\subsubsection*{Generation of human neural tube organoids}
The generation of human neural tube organoids falls under category 1a as defined by the ISSCR 2021 guidelines. 
Two induced Pluripotent Stem Cell lines (iPSC): IPSC EPITHELIAL-1 (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/SCR_013869-1/CVCL_EE38/resolver?q=SIGi001-A&l=SIGi001-A&i=rrid:cvcl_ee38-ebisc-sigi001-a}{RRID:CVCL\_EE38}; Purchased from Sigma-Aldrich iPSC0028 and hereafter referred to as Sigma iPSC), BJ1 iPSC (iPSC generated from BJ fibroblasts (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/SCR_013869-1/CVCL_3653/resolver?q=CRL-2522&l=CRL-2522&i=rrid:cvcl_3653-atcc-crl-2522}{RRID:CVCL\_3653}) and kindly gifted by professor Catherine Verfaillie (Leuven Stem Cell Institute)) and one human Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) line H9-ESC (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/SCR_013869-1/CVCL_9773/resolver?q=NIHhESC-10-0062&l=NIHhESC-10-0062&i=rrid:cvcl_9773-0}{RRID:CVCL\_9773} and kindly gifted by professor Pierre Vanderhaeghen) were used for the \textit{in vitro} generation of human neural tube organoids.
The identities of the cell lines were validated based on their genomic sequences (see Methods details below).
Pluripotent stem cells were cultured in flat bottom, TC-treated 6 well plates (Avantor; 734-2323). For culture details see
Methods details below. 
All human iPSC and ESC experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee of the KU Leuven (ECD S63316)
. Human neural tube organoids were generated based on Fattah \textit{et al.} 2021 Nature communications\cite{
abdelfattahActuationEnhancesPatterning2021} and Ranga \textit{et al.} 2016 PNAS\cite{rangaNeuralTubeMorphogenesis2016}.
At 60-70\% confluency pluripotent stem cells were washed twice using Phosphate Buffered Saline
(PBS; ThermoFisher, 14190169; 2ml) next a single cell suspension was made by adding 1ml of room temperature TrypLE
Express Enzyme (ThermoFisher, 12605010) and incubation for 3 minutes at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} followed by pipetting up and down using a
\SI{1}{\milli\litre} pipette. Immediately after the TrypLE reaction was inhibited by adding \SI{2}{\milli\liter} of DMEM/F12 FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; ThermoFisher, A5256701) \SI{20}{\percent} V/V; Penicillin-Streptomycin (ThermoFisher, 15140122) \SI{50}{\micro\gram} in DMEM/F12 (ThermoFisher, 11320033)). Cells were pelleted at 300 RCF for \SI{3}{\minute} and after counting on a LUNA-FL Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter resuspended to \SI{3.5e6}{cells\per\milli\litre} in $GM_0$ ( basal GM (N-2 Supplement (ThermoFisher, 17502048) 1x, B-27 Supplement (ThermoFisher, 17504044) 1x, GlutaMax Supplement (ThermoFisher, 35050061) 1x, Sodium Pyruvate (ThermoFisher, 11360070) \SI{1}{\milli\molar}, MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (ThermoFisher, 11140050) 1x, Penicillin-Streptomycin (ThermoFisher, 15140122) \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Neurobasal Medium (ThermoFisher, 21103049) \SI{50}{\percent} V/V and DMEM/F12 (ThermoFisher, 11320033) \SI{50}{\percent} V/V) with RHO/ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632 (Dihydrochloride), Stemcell technologies, 100-1044) \SI{1}{\micro\molar}). Next, the polyethylene glycol A (PEG-A) hydrogel matrix (see Methods detail below) was prepared by first adding Corning Mouse Laminin (Avantor, 734-1098) \SI{0.1}{\milli\gram\per\milli\liter} followed by activated factor 13 (see Methods details below) in that order to a PEG mixture (see Methods details below; PEG \SI{1.5}{\percent} or \SI{2}{\percent} V/V, buffer (TRIS \SI{0.05}{\milli\molar}, $CaCl_2$ \SI{0.05}{\milli\molar}; pH 7.6; filter sterilized) in $GM_0$ medium). After mixing the matrix by pipetting up and down, without generating bubbles, for 1-2 minutes \SI{3.5e4}{cells\per\micro\litre} mixture were added. The matrix and gell mixture was mixed gently one more time by pipetting and \SI{10}{\micro\litre} droplets were generated in each well of a TC-treated 96 well plate (Corning, 3603). When the matrix started to gell the plate was turned up-side down for 10 seconds, after which it was turned right-side up for 10 seconds. This was repeated for a total of 5 times, after which the plates were kept at room temperature. After 20 minutes of gelling \SI{200}{\micro\litre} of $GM_0$ medium was added to each well and the organoids were incubated at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} \SI{5}{\percent} $CO_2$ for a total of 11 days, or until the timepoint of single-cell multiome. At day 3 of differentiation medium was changed with basal GM supplemented with retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, R2625-100MG) \SI{0.25}{\micro\molar} and Smoothened agonist (Sigma-Aldrich, 566661-500UG) \SI{1}{\micro\molar}. At day 5, 7 and 9 the medium was changed with basal GM. 

\subsubsection*{Chicken embryos}
Fertilized chicken eggs, obtained from "Kwekerij van het Hallerbos" were incubated at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} at \SI{70}{\percent} humidity for 30 hours to reach Humburger Hamilton (HH) stage 4. Afterwards, embryos were removed from the egg and kept in culture for an additional 24 hours.

\subsubsection*{Human neural tube organoid culture}

\paragraph*{Factor 13 activation}
\SI{1}{\units} of reconstituted Thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich, 10602400001) in Ehrbars buffer (TRIS \SI{10}{\milli\molar}; NaCl
\SI{150}{\milli\molar}; $CaCl_2$ \SI{25}{\milli\molar}; pH 7.4) per \SI{90}{\units} of reconstituted Fibrogammin (UZ Leuven pharmacy)
was mixed and put in water bath at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} for 30 minutes while swirling every 5 minutes. Activated
factor 13 was filter sterilized, aliquoted and stored at \SI{-80}{\degreeCelsius}.

\paragraph*{PEG-A hydrogel precursor synthesis}
PEG-A hydrogel precursors, as described in Ranga \textit{et al.} nature
communications\cite{ranga3DNicheMicroarrays2014}, were kindly gifted by professor Adrian Ranga (Department of Mechanical
Engineering at KU Leuven).

\paragraph*{Human pluripotent stem cell culture}
TC-treated well plates were coated using Geltrex Matrix (ThermoFisher, A1413301) as follows. Geltrex Matrix was thawed
in ice over night at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius} and diluted in DMEM/F12 (ThermoFisher, 11320033) \SI{1}{\percent} V/V.
Sufficient amount of diluted Geltrex Matrix was added to each well to coat the surface and the culture plates were
incubated at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} for a minimum of 60 minutes. Remaining Geltrex mixture was removed prior to
culture. Human Pluripotent stem cells were cultured on the Geltrex Matrix coated well plates at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius}
\SI{5}{\percent} $CO_2$ in Essential 8 Flex Medium (ThermoFisher, A2858501) supplemented with Penicillin-Streptomycin (ThermoFisher, 15140122) \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}. Medium was changed every other day. Cells were passaged when they reached \SI{70}{\percent} by washing them twice using DPBS without Calcium and Magnesium (ThermoFisher, 14190) and adding EDTA (ThermoFisher, 15575020) \SI{0.5}{\milli\molar} followed by incubation at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius}. After 3-4 minutes the EDTA solution was aspirated and replaced by Essential 8 Flex Medium. Cells were scraped using a cell scraper (Corning, 734-0385) and split in a 1:6 ratio.

\paragraph*{single cell suspension}
PEG hydrogel droplets were removed from the 96 well plate by gently scraping with a \SI{100}{\micro\litre} pipette tip
and transferred to a tube on ice using a p1000 pipette by putting the pipette tip on the droplet and creating a gentle
negative pressure, making sure that the droplet does not enter the pipette tip. Organoids were dissociated by adding room temperature TrypLE Express Enzyme (ThermoFisher, 12605010) and incubation at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} while pipetting up and down until no large pieces of hydrogel were visible anymore or a maximum of 7.5 minutes. Immediately after the TrypLE reaction was inhibited by adding twice the volume of DMEM/F12 FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; ThermoFisher, A5256701) \SI{20}{\percent} V/V; Penicillin-Streptomycin (ThermoFisher, 15140122) \SI{50}{\micro\gram} in DMEM/F12 (ThermoFisher, 11320033)). The single-cell suspension was pelleted at 500 RCF for 4 minutes, resuspended in DMEM/F12 FBS and counted on LUNA-FL Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter. Immediately after the cells were processed for 10x single-cell multiome.

\subsubsection*{Human neural tube organoid multiome}

\paragraph*{10x multiome nuclei isolation}
To isolate nuclei from the single cells of the dissociated neural tube organoids, protocol CG000365 (10x Genomics) 
was followed. 
For each developmental time point, 500k cells were resuspended in 100 µl nuclei lysis buffer 
(\SI{10}{\milli\molar} Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 
\SI{10}{\milli\molar} NaCl; 
\SI{3}{\milli\molar} $MgCl_2$; 
\SI{0.1}{\percent} Tween-20; 
\SI{0.1}{\percent} NP40; 
\SI{0.01}{\percent} Digitonin;
\SI{1}{\percent} BSA; 
\SI{1}{\milli\molar} DTT and 
\SI{1}{\units\per\micro\litre} RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor 
in nuclease-free water
). 
After 5 min incubation on ice, \SI{1}{\milli\litre} chilled wash buffer was added to the lysed cells 
(
\SI{10}{\milli\molar} Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 
\SI{10}{\milli\molar} NaCl; 
\SI{3}{\milli\molar} $MgCl_2$; 
\SI{0.1}{\percent} Tween-20; 
\SI{1}{\percent} BSA; 
\SI{1}{\milli\molar} DTT and 
\SI{1}{\units\per\micro\litre} RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor in 
nuclease-free water
). 
Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius} and 
resuspended in a 1x nuclei buffer (10x Genomics) supplemented with 
\SI{1}{\milli\molar} dithiothreitol and \SI{1}{\units\per\micro\litre} RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor. 
Nuclei suspensions were passed through a \SI{40}{\micro\meter} Flowmi filter (VWR Bel-Art SP Scienceware). 
Nuclei concentration was assessed using the LUNA-FL Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter.

\paragraph*{10x multiome library preparation}
Single-cell libraries were generated using the 10X Chromium Single-Cell Instrument and NextGEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC+Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
In brief, single nuclei of neural tube organoids were incubated for 60 min at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} 
with a transposase that fragments the DNA in open regions of the chromatin and adds adapter sequences to the 
ends of the DNA fragments. 
After generation of nanoliter-scale gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs), 
GEMs were incubated in a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) under the following program: 
\SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} for 45 min, \SI{25}{\degree} for 30 min, and hold at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}. 
Incubation of the GEMs produced 10x barcoded DNA from the transposed DNA (for ATAC) and 10x barcoded, 
full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA (for GEX). 
This was followed by a quenching step that stopped the reaction. 
After quenching, single-cell droplets were broken and the transposed DNA and full-length cDNA were isolated using
Cleanup Mix containing Silane Dynabeads. 
To fill gaps and generate sufficient mass for library construction, the transposed DNA and cDNA were amplified via PCR: 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 5 min; 
\SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 3 min; 
seven cycles of 
\SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 20 s, 
\SI{63}{\degreeCelsius} for 30 s, 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 1 min; 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 1 min; 
and hold at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}. 
The pre-amplified product was used as input for both ATAC library construction and cDNA amplification for gene
expression library construction. 
Illumina P7 sequence and a sample index were added to the single-strand DNA during ATAC library construction via PCR:
\SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 45 s;
7–9 cycles of \SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 20 s, 
\SI{67}{\degreeCelsius} for 30 s, 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 20 s;
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 1 min; 
and hold at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}. 
The sequencing-ready ATAC library was cleaned up with SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter). 
Barcoded, full-length pre-amplified cDNA was further amplified via PCR: 
\SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 3 min; 
6–9 cycles of 
\SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 15 s, 
\SI{63}{\degreeCelsius} for 20 s, 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 1 min; 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 1 min; 
and hold at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}. 
Subsequently, the amplified cDNA was fragmented, end-repaired, A-tailed, and index adaptor ligated, 
with SPRIselect cleanup in between steps. 
The final gene expression library was amplified by PCR: 
\SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 45 s; 
5–16 cycles of 
\SI{98}{\degreeCelsius} for 20 s,
\SI{54}{\degreeCelsius} for 30 s, 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 20 s, 
\SI{72}{\degreeCelsius} for 1 min; 
and hold at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}. 
The sequencing-ready GEX library was cleaned up with SPRIselect beads.

\paragraph*{10x multiome sequencing}

\subsubsection*{Human embryo sample preparation}

\paragraph*{10x multiome library preparation}
Tissue was gently minced using a razor blade and cells were dissociated using a papain dissociation kit (Worthington)
with \SI{200}{\units\per\milli\litre} DNAse at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} for 10 min following the manufacturer’s provided protocol.
The suspension was triturated using a glass pipette to dissolve remaining clumps before being filtered 
through a \SI{30}{\micro\meter} filter (CellTrics). 
After dissociation, the cells were washed with 1X EBSS and concentrated (200g, 5 min). 
1 x $10^6$ cells were pelleted (500g, 5 min) in a 2 ml LoBind Eppendorf tube. 
Nuclei were then isolated from the pellet by incubating them with \SI{100}{\micro\litre}
dissociation mix 
(
  \SI{0.001}{\percent} digitonin, 
  \SI{0.01}{\percent} NP40, 
  \SI{1}{\milli\molar} dithiothreitol, 
  \SI{1}{\units\per\micro\litre} RNAse inhibitor, 
  \SI{0.1}{\percent} Tween-20,

  \SI{10}{\milli\molar} Tris-HCl, 
  \SI{10}{\milli\molar} NaCl, 
  \SI{3}{\milli\molar} $MgCl_2$
) 
for 5 min before adding 1 ml wash buffer 
  (

  \SI{3}{\milli\molar} $MgCl_2$
), pelleting the isolated nuclei (500g, 5 min) and resuspending in 1X nuclei buffer (10X Genomics). 
Single-cell libraries were generated using the 10X Chromium Single-Cell Instrument and 
NextGEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC+Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol as 
described in the human neural tube organoids section. 
In total, 4 ATAC and 4 Gene Expression libraries were generated for the embryonal sample.

\paragraph*{10x multiome library sequencing}
The fragment size of the libraries were analyzed using the Bioanalyzer high-sensitivity chip. 
All embryonal libraries were first sequenced on the NextSeq2000 instrument (Illumina) before being sequenced deeper on 
the NovaSeq6000 instrument (lllumina).

Eight individual single-cell multiome libraries were generated:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A single library containing a mix of organoids at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 days of differentiation cultured in \SI{1.5}{\percent} PEG hydrogel matrix (IPS\_\_081787\_\_575955\_\_10x\_multiome\_neural\_tube\_organoids\_1\_5\_PEG).

\end{itemize}

For each sample a mix of H9-ESC, Sigma iPSC and BJ1 iPSC cells were used.

\paragraph*{RNA count matrices and ATAC fragment files}
single-cell RNA count matrices and single-cell ATAC fragment files were generated for each sample using the Cell Ranger
ARC (v2.0.2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_023897/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_023897}) command
cellranger-arc count command using as the GRCh38 reference genome supplied with Cell Ranger ARC (v2020-A-2.0.0).

\paragraph*{Cell line demultiplexing}
Variants were called from in house Omni-ATAC-seq\cite{corcesImprovedATACseqProtocol2017} data that was performed on each
cell line individually (unpublished data). 
First, bam files per cell line were merged using samtools\cite{liSequenceAlignmentMap2009} (v1.11; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_002105/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_002105}) merge, sorted using samtools sort and indexed using samtools index. 
Next, for each cell line merged bam file common variants were called using the bcftools\cite{liStatisticalFrameworkSNP2011} (v1.11; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_005227/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_005227}) mpileup command using common short genetic variants from 1000 Genomes project as targets parameter (-T) and 8,000 as max depth (-D) parameter followed by the call command from bcftools. 
Next, single-cell multiome samples were demultixpled per cell line using popscle (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026707/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026707}) demuxlet\cite{kangMultiplexedDropletSinglecell2018} after first sorting the variant VCF file as the single-cell multiome sample bam file, using a custom script sort\_VCF\_same\_as\_bam, filtering the sample bam file to only retain reads that overlap with SNPs in the VCF file and have a valid barcode passing the Cell Ranger ARC quality control, using a custom script filter\_bam\_file\_for\_popscle\_dsc\_pileup, (custom scripts can be found in the popscle\_helper\_tools GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/aertslab/popscle_helper_tools}{https://github.com/aertslab/popscle\_helper\_tools}) and creating a pileup of reads for each SNP in the VCF file and each cell barcode using the single-cell multiome sample bam file and finally popscle demuxlet was run on the sample pileup, variant VCF file using GT as field (--field) parameter.

\paragraph*{single-cell RNA quality control}
Cells with less than 3 genes expressed and genes expressed in less than 200 cells were removed using the Scanpy\cite{wolfSCANPYLargescaleSinglecell2018} (v1.9.1; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_018139/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_018139}) functions filter\_cells and filter\_genes.
Next, quality control metrics were calculated using the Scanpy function calculate\_qc\_metrics using qc\_vars=["mt"],
percent\_top = None and log1p = False as parameters.
Cells with less than \SI{25}{\percent} mitochondrial counts, more than a total of 2,000 counts and less than a total of
9,000 genes with counts were kept resulting in a total of 27,552 cells passing quality control.

\paragraph*{single-cell RNA batch effect correction}
Batch effect correction was performed using harmonypy\cite{korsunskyFastSensitiveAccurate2019} (v0.0.1; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_022798/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_022798}) using as batch key the combination of experimental batch and cell line on 50 PCA coordinates calculated using the Scanpy \cite{wolfSCANPYLargescaleSinglecell2018} (v1.9.1; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_018139/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_018139}) function pca.

\paragraph*{single-cell RNA cell type annotation}
Cells were first annotated as Facial mesenchyme, Neural crest, Neuron, Peripheral neuron, Pluripotent stem cell or
neural progenitor by 
first normalizing, log transforming and scaling the gene expression matrix using the Scanpy\cite{wolfSCANPYLargescaleSinglecell2018} (v1.9.1; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_018139/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_018139}) functions normalize\_per\_cell, log1p and scale
and clustering the cells using the Leiden algorithm\cite{traagLouvainLeidenGuaranteeing2019} at a resolution of 5.1 (making use of the leiden function from Scanpy), 
calculating the median expression per cluster, 
binarizing this matrix using a gene expression threshold of 0, 
and calculating the jaccard distance using Scipy\cite{virtanenSciPy10Fundamental2020} (v1.9.3; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_008058/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_008058}) between the binarized median expression matrix and a knowledge matrix where containing marker genes per cell type and where the value is 1 for markers of that cell type and 0 otherwise constructed from the marker gene table (\textbf{Supplemental table S1}). 
For each cluster, the annotation with minimal distance was selected breaking ties by selecting a random annotation with equal distance.
neural progenitors were further annotated as neural progenitor, neural progenitor early neuron, KRT19+ neural
progenitors, FOXG1+ neural progenitors, NFE2L3+ neural progenitors and KRT19+/NFE2L3+ neural progenitors using the
same procedure at a Leiden resolution of 1.9 after subsetting for neural progenitors and re-normalizing, scaling and
integrating (see batch effect correction) the data.
non FOXG1+, NFE2L3+ or KRT19+ neural progenitors were further annotated as FP, p3, p0-2, dp1-6 or RP by subsetting non FOXG1+, NFE2L3+ or KRT19+ neural progenitors, re-normalizing, scaling and integrating (see batch effect correction) the data. Next, a force-directed graph embedding\cite{islamCharacterizationSinglecellTranscriptional2011, jacomyForceAtlas2ContinuousGraph2014} was calculated using the Scanpy function draw\_graph followed by diffusion pseudotime inference\cite{haghverdiDiffusionPseudotimeRobustly2016} using the Scanpy function dpt and binned in 15 and 50 bins using the Pandas\cite{thepandasdevelopmentPandasdevPandasPandas2024} (v1.5.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_018214/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_018214}) cut function. 
Using the same procedure as described above cell type annotations were determined for binned pseudotime in 50 bins and
for each bin of the binned pseudotime in 15 bins the most common annotation was selected.
Neural crest cells were further annotated as pre-migratory neural crest, bonafide neural crest, EMT neural crest,
mesenchyme and peripheral neuron manually based on the expression of marker genes.
Neuron cells and neural progenitor early neuron cells were further annotated as ASCL1+ Neurons, SST+ Neurons, SOX2+ Neurons,
ASCL1+ Neurons, UNCX+ Neurons, GAD1+ Neurons and GATA2+ Neurons based on the expression of marker genes.

\paragraph*{single-cell ATAC consensus peaks}
A set of consensus peaks was called by first generating pseudobulk ATAC-seq profiles for each of the highest resolution
cell types (see single-cell RNA cell type annotation) using the export\_pseudobulk function, with default parameters, from pycisTopic\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023}
(v1.0.3.dev20+g8955c76, \href{}{RRID:SCR\_026618}) followed by peak calling using MACS\cite{zhangModelbasedAnalysisChIPSeq2008} (v2.2.9.1; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_013291/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_013291} ) using the pycisTopic function peak\_calling, using default parameters, and consensus peak generation using the pycisTopic function get\_consensus\_peaks, using a peak width of 500 bp and default parameters. This resulted in 488,211 consensus peaks.

\paragraph*{single-cell ATAC quality control}
Sample and barcode level quality control data was calculated using the compute\_qc\_stats function from
pycisTopic\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023} (v1.0.3.dev20+g8955c76, \href{}{RRID:SCR\_026618})

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Cells that were predicted as doublets by demuxlet (see: Cell line demultiplexing) were also filtered out resulting in a
total of 28,705 cells passing quality control.

\paragraph*{single-cell ATAC topic modeling}
Four topic models were generated: one on all cells, one on the subset of cells annotated as neural progenitors, one on
the subset of cells annotated as neuron (Neuron cells and neural progenitor early neuron cells) and one on the subset of cells annotated as neural crest.
Topic modeling was performed using Mallet\cite{mccallumMALLETMachineLearning2002} (v202108; RRID:SCR\_026708) using the pycisTopic\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023} (v1.0.3.dev20+g8955c76, \href{https://rrid.site/datmccallumMALLETMachineLearning2002618/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026618}) function run\_cgs\_models\_mallet using 500 iterations, alpha equal to 50, eta equal to 0.1, alpha\_by\_topic equal to True and eta\_by\_topic equal to False and using random seed 555. 
Topic modeling was performed separately for all cells and for each subset of cells.
Model evaluation was performed using the pycisTopic function evaluate\_model that calculates model coherence\cite{mimno-etal-2011-optimizing}, log-likelihood\cite{griffithsFindingScientificTopics2004}, model density\cite{arunFindingNaturalNumber2010} and a divergence-based metric\cite{caoDensitybasedMethodAdaptive2009}.
A model of 50 topics was selected for the model containing all cells,
a model of 30 topics was selected for the model containing neural progenitors,
a model of 25 topics was selected for the model containing neurons and
a model of 20 topics for the model containing neural crest cells.
The region topic probability matrix was thresholded using the binarize\_topics function from pycisTopic using the otsu
method\cite{otsuThresholdSelectionMethod1979} and the cell topic probability matris using the same function using the li
method\cite{liMinimumCrossEntropy1993}.

for the dense layers, the convolutional layers were l2 normalized using an epsilon value of 1e-6 and the dense layers were
l2 normalized using an epsilon value of 1e-3. The Adam optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0.001 that was dynamically scaled and binary cross entropy as a loss function and a batch size of 1,024.
Model was built and trained using Tensorflow (v2.41; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_016345/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_016345}). 
As training data all binarized topics (see single-cell ATAC topic modeling) from the subset of neural progenitors,
neurons and neural crest together with 10 topics form the topic model containing all cells representing the pluripotent
stem cell state were used for a total of 75 classes/topics. 
Data was augmented by training on both forward and reverse complement sequence and \SI{10}{\percent} of the data was
used for validation and \SI{10}{\percent} for testing for a total of 5,192,175 training samples, 650,280 test samples
and 647,805 validation samples. 
Based on the validation area under the precision recall curve and validation area under the receiver operator curve the

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Human embryo data analysis}

\paragraph*{RNA count matrices and ATAC fragment files}
single-cell RNA count matrices and single-cell ATAC fragment files were generated using the 
Cell Ranger ARC (v2.0.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_023897/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_023897}) command cellranger-arc count using GRCh38.p13 Gencode V35 primary sequence assembly as a reference genome as described in Braun \textit{et al.}\cite{braunComprehensiveCellAtlas2023}.

\paragraph*{single-cell RNA quality control}
Cells with less than 3 genes expressed and genes expressed in less than 200 cells were removed using the 
Scanpy\cite{wolfSCANPYLargescaleSinglecell2018} (v1.8.2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_018139/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_018139}) functions filter cells and filter genes. 
Next, quality control metrics were calculated using the Scanpy function calculate qc metrics using qc vars=[”mt”], 
percent top = [20] and log1p = True as parameters. 
Cells were filtered if they were more than 5 median absolute distances (MADs) away from the median log1p transcript count,
log1p number of genes or percentage counts in top 20 genes, 
or more than 3 MADs away from the median mitochondrial fraction, resulting in 34,453 high quality cells. 
Doublets were detected using Scrublet\cite{wolockScrubletComputationalIdentification2019} (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_018098/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_018098}) with a threshold of 0.2 and expected doublet rate of 6\%. 
Counts were normalized to 10,000, log transformed and scaled. 
The top 20,000 highly variable genes were identified using the highly\_variable\_genes function using flavor=’seurat’. 
The top 50 PCA components were used to calculate KNN neighbors and leiden clustering at a resolution of 0.3.

\paragraph*{single-cell RNA cell type annotation}
Clusters that were \textit{TUBB3}+, \textit{ELAVL3}+, \textit{INA}+, \textit{STMN2}+ and \textit{MAP2}+ were annotated as neurons, 
with the additional expression of \textit{SIX}1 indicating peripheral neurons. 
\textit{SOX2}, \textit{PAX6}, \textit{RFX4} and \textit{PTPRZ} were used to annotate neural progenitor cells. 
Neural crest was identified based on the expression of \textit{SOX10}, \textit{TFAP2A}, \textit{TFAP2B}, 
\textit{PAX3} and \textit{GRHL2}. 
\textit{FOXC1}, \textit{FOXC2} and \textit{TWIST1} were used as mesenchymal markers 
and \textit{FLT1}, \textit{PTPRM} and \textit{CLDN5} conversely were used to annotate endothelial cells. 
\textit{OTOGL} and \textit{OC90} marked the Otic placode and microglia were based on \textit{RUNX1} and \textit{CSF1R}.
Neurons and neural progenitors were subclustered and neuronal subtypes were annotated based on the expression of 
\textit{ASCL1}, \textit{UNCX}, \textit{GAD1}, \textit{GATA2}, \textit{SST} and \textit{SOX2}.
Conversely, the floor and roof plate in were identified among the neural progenitor cells based on the expression of 
\textit{SHH} and \textit{MSX1} respectively. 
Conversely, regionalization was assessed based on expression of
\textit{FOXG1}/\textit{EMX2} (forebrain), \textit{OTX2}/\textit{EN1} (midbrain), \textit{PAX8} (hindbrain) and \textit{HOXB3} (spinal cord).


\paragraph*{single-cell ATAC consensus peaks}

Pseudobulk ATAC-seq profiles were generated for each of the leiden clusters by using the pycisTopic\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023} (v1.0.3.dev20+g8955c76, RRID:SCR\_026618) export pseudobulk function, with default parameters. 
Peak calling was done using the pycisTopic peak calling function, which uses MACS\cite{zhangModelbasedAnalysisChIPSeq2008} (v2.2.9.1; RRID:SCR 013291 ). 
Per cluster peaksets were merged using the pycisTopic function get consensus peaks, 
using a peak width of 500 bp and default parameters, resulting in 610,282 peaks.

\paragraph*{single-cell ATAC quality control}
Sample and barcode level quality control data was calculated using the pycisTopic\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023} (v2.0a, \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026618/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026618}) command pycistopic qc, using a TSS annotation bed file that was generated using the pycisTopic command pycistopic tss get\_tss using hsapiens\_gene\_ensembl as biomart name. High quality cells were selected based on the number of unique fragments per cell and TSS enrichment. The minimal number of unique fragments per cell was automatically determined using otsu thresholding \cite{otsuThresholdSelectionMethod1979} and a TSS enrichment threshold of 7 was used. This resulted in 38,998 high quality cells passing quality control.

\paragraph*{single-cell ATAC topic modeling}
Three topic models were generated: one on the subset of cells annotated as neural progenitors, on on the subset of
cells annotated as neuron and one on the subset of cells annotated as neural crest. First, a fragment count matrix was
generated for each sample using the pycisTopic\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023} (v2.0a, \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026618/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026618}) function create\_fragments\_matrix\_from\_fragments, this matrix was binarized (\textgreater 0), merged in one count matrix using the Scipy\cite{virtanenSciPy10Fundamental2020} (v1.15.2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_008058/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_008058}) function sparse.hstack and subsequently split in a matrix for each of neural progenitors, neurons and neural crest cells and saved as matrix market format. A mallet corpus file was generated for each binary matrix using the pycisTopic command pycistopic topic\_modeling mallet create\_corpus and finally topic modeling was run using Mallet\cite{mccallumMALLETMachineLearning2002} (v202108; RRID:SCR\_026708) using the pycisTopic command: pycistopic topic\_modeling mallet run using 300 iterations and default parameters otherwise. Model evaluation was performed using the pycisTopic command pycistopic topic\_modeling mallet stats that calculates model coherence\cite{mimno-etal-2011-optimizing}, log-likelihood\cite{griffithsFindingScientificTopics2004}, model density\cite{arunFindingNaturalNumber2010} and a divergence-based metric\cite{caoDensitybasedMethodAdaptive2009}.
A model of 60 topics was selected for the model containing neural progenitors,
a model of 30 topics was selected for the model containing neurons and
a model of 30 topics for the model containing neural crest cells.
The region topic probability matrix was thresholded using the binarize\_topics function from pycisTopic using the otsu
method\cite{otsuThresholdSelectionMethod1979} and the cell topic probability matris using the same function using the li
method\cite{liMinimumCrossEntropy1993}.

\paragraph*{Training $DeepNeuralTube_E$}
A deepTopic model\cite{minnoyeCrossspeciesAnalysisEnhancer2020}, now implemented in
CREsted\cite{kempynckCREstedModelingGenomic2025} (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026617/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026617}), containing 5 convolutional and max pooling layers: dimensions (500,
1,024), (125, 512), (32, 512), (8, 512) and (2, 512) a fully connected dense layer of dimension 1,024 and a dense output
layer of dimension 75 was trained to classify consensus peaks in topics based on their genomic sequence. GELU was used as activaiton function, 17 as
kernel size, 4 as max pooling size, a dropout of 0.15 was used for the convolutional layers, a dropout of 0.5 was used
for the dense layers, the convolutional layers were l2 normalized using an epsilon value of 1e-6 and the dense layers were
l2 normalized using an epsilon value of 1e-3. The Adam optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0.001 that was dynamically scaled and binary cross entropy as a loss function and a batch size of 1,024.
Model was built and trained using Tensorflow (v2.41; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_016345/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_016345}). 
As training data all binarized topics (see single-cell ATAC topic modeling) from the subset of neural progenitors,
neurons and neural crest together were used for a total of 120 classes/topics. 
Data was augmented by training on both forward and reverse complement sequence and \SI{10}{\percent} of the data was
used for validation and \SI{10}{\percent} for testing for a total of 11,935,075 training samples, 1,494,835 test samples
and 1,497,350 validation samples. 
Based on the validation area under the precision recall curve and validation area under the receiver operator curve the
model after 36 epochs was selected.
The classes of the model correspond as follows to the different data subsets: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item $0 \leq class_{index} < 30 $: neuron
  \item $30 \leq class_{index} < 90$: neural progenitor
  \item $90 \leq class_{index} < 120$: Neural crest
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Cell cycle annotation}
Marker genes of the S-phase and G2 and M phase of the cell cycle\cite{tiroshDissectingMulticellularEcosystem2016} were
used in the Scanpy\cite{wolfSCANPYLargescaleSinglecell2018} (v1.11.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_018139/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_018139}) function score\_genes\_cell\_cycle.

\subsubsection*{Motif enrichment analysis}

A cistarget motif ranking database was created by first getting the genomic sequence of each organoid consensus peak with 1,000 bp background padding using the create\_fasta\_with\_padded\_bg\_from\_bed script from the create\_cisTarget\_databases repository (\href{https://github.com/aertslab/create_cisTarget_databases}{https://github.com/aertslab/create\_cisTarget\_databases}) and scoring each DNA sequence using Cluster-Buster\cite{frithClusterBusterFindingDense2003}(\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_024810/resolver?}{RRID:SCR\_024810}) using the create\_cisTarget\_databases command create\_cistarget\_motif\_databases followed by the generation of the ranking databases using the command convert\_motifs\_or\_tracks\_vs\_regions\_or\_genes\_scores\_to\_rankings\_cistarget\_dbs. Next, the SCENIC+\cite{bravogonzalez-blasSCENICSinglecellMultiomic2023} (v1.0a2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026702/resolver?}{RRID:SCR\_026702}) command scenicplus grn\_inference motif\_enrichment\_cistarget command was used to perform cisTarget\cite{potierUsingCisTargetXPredict2012} motif enrichment analysis for each organoid and embryo topic.

\subsubsection*{Annotating embryo cells based on organoid topics}
A matrix multiplication between the region-topic probabilities of organoid topics and the binarized embryo fragment
count matrix was performed to obtain an imputed embryo cell topics probability matrix (where the topics are organoid
topics). This matrix was binarized by taking the top 1,000 cells per topic.

\subsubsection*{\textit{de novo} motif discovery}
For all organoid and embryo topics using respectively $DeepNeuralTube_O$ and $DeepNeuralTube_E$ attribution scores
were calculated using the CREsted\cite{kempynckCREstedModelingGenomic2025} (v1.3.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026617/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026617}) function integrated\_grad, on 1,000 regions with the highest prediction score for that topic according to the model. Next, patterns/motifs were discovered \textit{de novo} using a custom implementation of tfmodisco-lite (v2.0.0; RRID:SCR\_026709). First seqlets were called using the tfmodisco-lite function extract\_seqlets using the attribution scores as input and using parameters 
sliding\_window\_size = 15, 
flank = 5, 
suppress = 12, 
target\_fdr = 0.2, 
min\_passing\_windows\_frac = 0.03, 
max\_passing\_windows\_frac = 0.3 and 
weak\_threshold\_for\_counting\_sig = 0.8. 
Next, the attribution score of each seqlet was extracted based on the seqlet coordinates and negative and positive seqlets were defined based on the sum of the attribution score without the flank filtering out seqlets for which the abolute value of the sum of the attribution score was lower than or equal to X. 
Finally, separately for positive and negative seqlets 1,000 seqlets were sampled and used in the tfmodisco-lite function seqlet\_to\_patterns using parameters 
min\_overlap\_while\_sliding = 0.7,
nearest\_neighbors\_to\_compute = 500,
affmat\_correlation\_threshold = 0.15,
tsne\_perplexity = 10,
n\_leiden\_iterations = -1,
n\_leiden\_runs = 50,
frac\_support\_to\_trim\_to = 0.2,
min\_num\_to\_trim\_to = 30,
trim\_to\_window\_size = 20,
initial\_flank\_to\_add = 5,
prob\_and\_pertrack\_sim\_merge\_thresholds = [(0.8,0.8), (0.5, 0.85), (0.2, 0.9)],
prob\_and\_pertrack\_sim\_dealbreaker\_thresholds = [(0.4, 0.75), (0.2,0.8), (0.1, 0.85), (0.0,0.9)],
subcluster\_perplexity = 50,
merging\_max\_seqlets\_subsample = 300,
final\_min\_cluster\_size = 20,
min\_ic\_in\_window = 0.6,
min\_ic\_windowsize = 6 and 
ppm\_pseudocount= 0.001.
Next, similar patterns were clustered together by first calculating a pairwise pattern-to-pattern similarity metric
using TomTom\cite{guptaQuantifyingSimilarityMotifs2007} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}). The Pearson correlation of one minus the E-value (product of the TomTom p-value and the number of patterns), calculated using the corrcoef function from NumPy\cite{harrisArrayProgrammingNumPy2020} (v2.0.1; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_008633/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_008633}), was used for hierarchical clustering using the hierarchy.linkage (using average as method) and fcluster (using maxclust as criterion and a manual defined number of clusters) functions from Scipy\cite{virtanenSciPy10Fundamental2020} (v1.15.2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_008058/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_008058}).


\subsubsection*{Validation of DeepNeuralTube organoid based on Vista enhancers}
Data was downloaded from the VISTA Enhancer browser\cite{viselVISTAEnhancerBrowsera2007, kosickiVISTAEnhancerBrowser2025} (\href{https://gitlab.com/egsb-mfgl/vista-data/-/raw/main/experiments.tsv.gz}{https://gitlab.com/egsb-mfgl/vista-data/-/raw/main/experiments.tsv.gz}) and the DNA sequence of each element was obtain either from the human genome (hg38) or the mouse genome (mm10) dependent on the origin of each sequence. In case a sequence was shorter than 500 bp (the input size of DeepNeuralTube) the sequence was extended to 500 bp based on the genomic coordinates. In case the sequence was larger than 500 bp a sliding window, with step size of 1, was produced over the sequence. A prediction score for each sequence and using both $DeepNeuralTube_O$ and $DeepNeuralTube_E$ was calculated and per experiment and output class of the model the maximum prediction score was retained. 
Ground truth neural tube enhancers were defined as enhancers that were positive in the tissue "nt", in at least 3 embryos and at
least \SI{50}{\percent} of tested embryos. 
Ground truth facial mesenchyme enhancers were defined as enhancers that were positive in the tissue "fm", in at least 3 embryos and at
least \SI{50}{\percent} of tested embryos. 
For both neural tube enhancers and facial mesenchyme enhancers precision-recall curves and receiver-operator curves were
calculated using respectively the function metrics.precision\_recall\_curve and metrics.roc\_curve from
Scikit-learn\cite{JMLR:v12:pedregosa11a}
(v1.5.2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_002577/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_002577}) using the maximum

\subsubsection*{Clustering of \textit{de novo} and enriched motifs}
A pairwise similarity matrix between all enriched motifs (see Motif enrichment analysis) and \textit{de novo} motifs was
calculated using TomTom\cite{guptaQuantifyingSimilarityMotifs2007} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}).

\paragraph*{\textit{ex ovo} enhancer-reporter injection}
Preparation of chicken embryos and injection was performed as described in Williams and Sauka-Spengler 2021\cite{
williamsExOvoElectroporation2021}.
Eggs were incubated as described above (see Chicken embryos). A hole was created in the egg shell using the back of
foreceps, thick albumin was discarded and thin albumin was collected. When most albumin was removed, the egg shell was
cut open and yolk turned so that embryo faces upwards. More albumin was removed from the yolk by stroking the yolk using
serrated forceps, moving away from (and not touching) the embryo. A Whatman filter paper with perforated hole was placed
on top of the embryo and yolk and whatman paper was cut using dissection scissors and embryo was removed and placed in
Ringer solution 
(

Embryos were transferred to \SI{15}{\percent} V/V sucrose in PBS at room temperature until they sank to the bottom. 
Next, embryos were transferred to a mixture consiting of \SI{7.5}{\percent} V/V gelatin and \SI{15}{\percent} V/V 
sucrose in PBS and were incubated overnight at \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius}. 
In the meantime \SI{20}{\percent} V/V gelatin was dissolved in PBS at \SI{60}{\degreeCelsius} and this was kept at 
\SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} once the gelatin was dissolved. 
After the overnight incubating, embryos were transferred to the gelatin solution and kept for a minimum of 4 hours at 
\SI{37}{\degreeCelsius}. 
Finally, embryos in gelatin solution were transferred to a cryomold and quickly frozen on an aluminum block cooled by 
dry ice.
Cryosections of \SI{20}{\micro\meter} were made at \SI{-14}{\degreeCelsius} and collected on SuperFrost Plus Adhesion 
slides (Fisher Scientific, 10149870). 
Sections were stained with DAPI (\SI{0.1}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, 28718-90-3) 
for 15 minutes, followed by a PBS wash and air dried. Cover slip was mounted using Mowiol 4-88 mounting medium
(Sigma-Aldrich, 81381-50G).


\subsubsection*{Code table}
For each pattern of the same cluster (see \textit{de novo} motif discovery) the optimal pairwise alignment was calculated using TomTom\cite{guptaQuantifyingSimilarityMotifs2007} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}). A seed pattern was selected, for each clusters, as the patterning with the highest information content. All patterns were aligned to the seed pattern and the average contribution score for each nucleotide and position was calculated for all pattern instances (seqlets) of the cluster and using all relevant classes of both models.

\subsubsection*{Footprinting analysis}
TN5 cut site BigWigs were calculated for all organoid topics using the bigwig command from
scatac\_fragment\_tools (v0.1.3; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026713/resolver?}{RRID:SCR\_026713})
using the --cut-sites option.
Next, for each pattern (converted to a PWM) of the FOX cluster of neural progenitors (cluster 6) motif hits were calculated on the top
1,000 regions of all neural progenitor topics using FIMO\cite{grantFIMOScanningOccurrences2011} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}) using default parameters.
Overlapping hits were resolved by taking the hit with the highest $-log_{10}(pvalue)$. 
For each sequence the maximum hit, based on the average contribution score of that hit for the topic from which the
region originated, was retained.
FOX patterns were aligned using TomTom\cite{guptaQuantifyingSimilarityMotifs2007} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}) to a seed pattern defined as the pattern with the highest information content.
Finally, regions were centered on the pattern hit position and TN5 cute site coverage was calculated using pyBigWig
(v0.3.24; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_024807/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_024807}).

\subsubsection*{General and specific FOXA2 target regions}
FOXA2 ChIP-seq peaks in HepG2 (\href{https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF466FCB/}{ENCFF466FCB}) and A549 \href{https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF686MSH/}{ENCFF686MSH} were downloaded from ENCODE (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_006793/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_006793}). 
For each pattern (converted to a PWM) of all neural progenitor pattern cluster motif hits were calculated on the top
1,000 regions of all neural progenitor topics using FIMO\cite{grantFIMOScanningOccurrences2011} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}) using default parameters.
For each sequence the maximum hit, based on the average contribution score of that hit for the topic from which the
region originated, was retained.
Attribution scores were normalized by dividing over the sum of attribution scores over all patterns per sequence.
FOX hits were defined as hits with a value greater than 0.0008 in organoid and 0.0004 in embryo.
To define general hits, the FOX hits were intersected with FOXA2 ChIP-seq peaks in HepG2 and A549 using bedtools (v2.31;
\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_006646/resolver?q=bedtools&l=bedtools&i=rrid:scr_006646}{RRID:SCR\_006646}) intersect using option -F 0.4 and peaks intersecting with either of the two ChIP-seq peak sets were defined as general.

\subsubsection*{Anterior-posterior HOX motif replacement}
For all patterns (convered to a PWM and trimmed based on information content using a threshold of 0.1) belonging to cluster 4 or 8 of anterior-posterior \textit{de novo} patterns hits
were calculated on the top, based on region-topic probabilities, 3,000 regions for topic 31 and topic 61 using  FIMO\cite{grantFIMOScanningOccurrences2011} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}) using default parameters. 
Hits for cluster 4 were replaced to 5\lq-AGGGATTAG-3\lq and hits for cluster 8 were replaced to 5\lq-CTAATTAG-3\lq.
If the hit was reverse complement, the reverse complement of those sequences was implanted.

\subsubsection*{Anterior-posterior synthetic enhancer design}
5\lq-GGATTAG-3\lq and 5\lq-CTAATTAG-3\lq were used as motifs in the CREsted\cite{kempynckCREstedModelingGenomic2025} (v1.3.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026617/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026617}) function enhancer\_design\_motif\_insertion to design 200 synthetic enhancers of length 500 for both topic 31 and 61 using up to 5 motif instances.

\subsubsection*{Anterior-posterior logistic regression model}
Motif scores for all patterns (convered to a PWM) belonging to cluster 4 or 8 of anterior-posterior \textit{de novo} patterns hits
were calculated on the top, based on region-topic probabilities, 3,000 regions for topic 31 and topic 61 using  FIMO\cite{grantFIMOScanningOccurrences2011} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}) using threshold parameter set to 0.5 to make sure each region gets a score for at least one pattern per cluster.
For each sequence and cluster the maximum score, based on the $-log_{10}(p-value)$ of the hit, was retained.
Regions were split in train and test set using the train\_test\_split function from
Scikit-learn\cite{JMLR:v12:pedregosa11a}
(v1.5.2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_002577/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_002577}) using test size of
\SI{33}{\percent} and random state 42.
A logistic regression model was fit (on training regions) to predict the difference between the log of topic 31 and topic 61 region topic
probabilities making use of the cluster 4 and cluster 8 motif scores as features.

\subsubsection*{Scoring facial GWAS variants}
SNPs reaching at least suggestive significance and lead SNPs were downloaded from Figshare doi: \href{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4667261.v7}{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4667261.v7}\cite{whiteInsightsGeneticArchitecture2021}. For each SNP the hg38 genomic coordinate and alternative alleles was downloaded using the Entrez Utilities (\href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_013249/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_013249}) API, scored using both $DeepNeuralTube_O$ and $DeepNeuralTube_E$ and difference between the prediction of reference and alternative allele was calculated (delta prediction score).

\subsubsection*{logistic regression models for each cell states}
For each cell type, neural progenitors dorso-ventral patterning, neural progenitors anterior-posterior patterning, neurons,
and neural crest, motif scores for all patterns (converted to a PWM) patterns belonging to clusters of the cell type\lq s
code-table hits were calculated on the top, based on region-topic probabilities, 1,000 regions for all topics of that
cell type\lq s code-table using FIMO\cite{grantFIMOScanningOccurrences2011} implemented in tangermeme (v0.4.0; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_026620/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_026620}) using threshold parameter set to 0.5 to make sure each region gets a score for at least one pattern per cluster.
For each sequence and cluster the maximum score, based on the $-log_{10}(p-value)$ of the hit, was retained.
Regions were split in train and test set using the train\_test\_split function from
Scikit-learn\cite{JMLR:v12:pedregosa11a}
(v1.5.2; \href{https://rrid.site/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_002577/resolver}{RRID:SCR\_002577}) using test size of
\SI{33}{\percent} and random state 42 for each topic.
For each topic per cell type a logistic regression model was fit (on training regions) to predict the difference between
the log of the region-topic probability and the maximum, across all other topics of that cell type, log of the
region-topic probability. Making use of the motif scores as features.
