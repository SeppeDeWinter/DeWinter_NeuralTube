  abstract = {Tissues achieve their complex spatial organization through an interplay between gene regulatory networks, cell-cell communication, and physical interactions mediated by mechanical forces. Current strategies to generate in-vitro tissues have largely failed to implement such active, dynamically coordinated mechanical manipulations, relying instead on extracellular matrices which respond to, rather than impose mechanical forces. Here, we develop devices that enable the actuation of organoids. We show that active mechanical forces increase growth and lead to enhanced patterning in an organoid model of the neural tube derived from single human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). Using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that organoid mechanoregulation due to actuation operates in a temporally restricted competence window, and that organoid response to stretch is mediated extracellularly by matrix stiffness and intracellularly by cytoskeleton contractility and planar cell polarity. Exerting active mechanical forces on organoids using the approaches developed here is widely applicable and should enable the generation of more reproducible, programmable organoid shape, identity and patterns, opening avenues for the use of these tools in regenerative medicine and disease modelling applications.},

  abstract = {Genomic sequence variation within enhancers and promoters can have a significant impact on the cellular state and phenotype. However, sifting through the millions of candidate variants in a personal genome or a cancer genome, to identify those that impact cis-regulatory function, remains a major challenge. Interpretation of noncoding genome variation benefits from explainable artificial intelligence to predict and interpret the impact of a mutation on gene regulation. Here we generate phased whole genomes with matched chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression for 10 melanoma cell lines. We find that training a specialized deep learning model, called DeepMEL2, on melanoma chromatin accessibility data can capture the various regulatory programs of the melanocytic and mesenchymal-like melanoma cell states. This model outperforms motif-based variant scoring, as well as more generic deep learning models. We detect hundreds to thousands of allele-specific chromatin accessibility variants (ASCAVs) in each melanoma genome, of which 15\%--20\% can be explained by gains or losses of transcription factor binding sites. A considerable fraction of ASCAVs are caused by changes in AP-1 binding, as confirmed by matched ChIP-seq data to identify allele-specific binding of JUN and FOSL1. Finally, by augmenting the DeepMEL2 model with ChIP-seq data for GABPA, the TERT promoter mutation, as well as additional ETS motif gains, can be identified with high confidence. In conclusion, we present a new integrative genomics approach and a deep learning model to identify and interpret functional enhancer mutations with allelic imbalance of chromatin accessibility and gene expression.},

Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100\,kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer--promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.},

However, the relationships between TFs, promoters and their associated cofactors remain poorly understood. Here we combine GAL4-transactivation assays with comparative CRISPR--Cas9 screens to identify the cofactors used by nine different TFs and core promoters in human cells. Using this dataset, we associate TFs with cofactors, classify cofactors as ubiquitous or specific and discover transcriptional co-dependencies. Through a reductionistic, comparative approach, we demonstrate that TFs do not display discrete mechanisms of activation. Instead, each TF depends on a unique combination of cofactors, which influences distinct steps in transcription. By contrast, the influence of core promoters appears relatively discrete. Different promoter classes are constrained by either initiation or pause-release, which influences their dynamic range and compatibility with cofactors. Overall, our comparative cofactor screens characterize the interplay between TFs, cofactors and core promoters, identifying general principles by which they influence transcription.},

  abstract = {Gene regulation in the human genome is controlled by distal enhancers that activate specific nearby promoters1. A proposed model for this specificity is that promoters have sequence-encoded preferences for certain enhancers, for example, mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors2. This `biochemical compatibility' model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila3--9. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible has not yet been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. Here we design a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer\,{\texttimes}\,promoter self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (ExP STARR-seq) and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify simple rules for enhancer--promoter compatibility, whereby most enhancers activate all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities multiplicatively combine to determine RNA output (R2\,=\,0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters show subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contain built-in activating motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, which decrease the responsiveness of promoters to distal enhancers. Promoters of variably expressed genes lack these motifs and show stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer--promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome.},

Here, using a combination of single-cell multiomics, spatial omics, massively parallel reporter assays and deep learning, we mapped enhancer-gene regulatory networks across mouse liver cell types. We found that zonation affects gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes, among other cell types. These states are driven by the repressors TCF7L1 and TBX3, alongside other core hepatocyte transcription factors, such as HNF4A, CEBPA, FOXA1 and ONECUT1. To examine the architecture of the enhancers driving these cell states, we trained a hierarchical deep learning model called DeepLiver. Our study provides a multimodal understanding of the regulatory code underlying hepatocyte identity and their zonation state that can be used to engineer enhancers with specific activity levels and zonation patterns.},

These distinctive attributes have inspired the curiosity of developmental biologists for over 150 years, however only recently the regulatory mechanisms controlling the complex features of the NC have started to become elucidated at genomic scales. Regulatory control of NC development is achieved through combinatorial transcription factor binding and recruitment of associated transcriptional complexes to distal cis-regulatory elements. Together, they regulate when, where and to what extent transcriptional programmes are actively deployed, ultimately shaping ontogenetic processes. Here, we discuss how transcriptional networks control NC ontogeny, with a special emphasis on the molecular mechanisms underlying specification of the cephalic NC. We also cover emerging properties of transcriptional regulation revealed in diverse developmental systems, such as the role of three-dimensional conformation of chromatin, and how they are involved in the regulation of NC ontogeny. Finally, we highlight how advances in deciphering the NC transcriptional network have afforded new insights into the molecular basis of human diseases.},

These models can capture word correlations in a collection of textual documents with a low-dimensional set of multinomial distribution, called ``topics''.

In this paper, we study the inherent connection between the best topic structure and the distances among topics in Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and propose a method of adaptively selecting the best LDA model based on density. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve performance matching the best of LDA without manually tuning the number of topics.},

Sei learns a vocabulary of regulatory activities, called sequence classes, using a deep learning model that predicts 21,907 chromatin profiles across {$>$}1,300 cell lines and tissues. Sequence classes provide a global classification and quantification of sequence and variant effects based on diverse regulatory activities, such as cell type-specific enhancer functions.

Furthermore, sequence classes enable characterization of the tissue-specific, regulatory architecture of complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses for individual regulatory pathogenic mutations.

The model learned relevant TF motifs and higher-order syntax rules, including functionally nonequivalent instances of the same TF motif that are determined by motif-flanking sequence and intermotif distances. We validated these rules experimentally and demonstrated that they can be generalized to humans by testing more than 40,000 wildtype and mutant Drosophila and human enhancers. Finally, we designed and functionally validated synthetic enhancers with desired activities de novo.},

We first train convolutional neural networks using genome-wide single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq)~datasets and then fine-tune the convolutional neural networks with smaller-scale data from in vivo enhancer activity assays, yielding models with 13\% to 76\% positive predictive value according to cross-validation. We designed and experimentally assessed 40 synthetic enhancers (8 per tissue) in vivo, of which 31 (78\%) were active and 27 (68\%) functioned in the target tissue (100\% for central nervous system and muscle). The strategy of combining genome-wide and small-scale functional datasets by transfer learning is generally applicable and should enable the design of tissue-, cell type- and cell state-specific enhancers in any system.},

  abstract = {Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors that work together to read cis-regulatory DNA sequences. The `cis-regulatory code' --- how cells interpret DNA sequences to determine when, where and how much genes should be expressed --- has proven to be exceedingly complex. Recently, advances in the scale and resolution of functional genomics assays and machine learning have enabled substantial progress towards deciphering this code. However, the cis-regulatory code will probably never be solved if models are trained only on genomic sequences; regions of homology can easily lead to overestimation of predictive performance, and our genome is too short and has insufficient sequence diversity to learn all relevant parameters. Fortunately, randomly synthesized DNA sequences enable testing a far larger sequence space than exists in our genomes, and designed DNA sequences enable targeted queries to maximally improve the models. As the same biochemical principles are used to interpret DNA regardless of its source, models trained on these synthetic data can predict genomic activity, often better than genome-trained models. Here we provide an outlook on the field, and propose a roadmap towards solving the cis-regulatory code by a combination of machine learning and massively parallel assays using synthetic DNA.},

However, for many of these regulators we do not know what type of effector domains they contain, their location in the protein, their activation and repression strengths, and the sequences that are necessary for their functions. Here, we systematically measure the effector activity of more than 100,000 protein fragments tiling across most chromatin regulators and transcription factors in human cells (2,047 proteins). By testing the effect they have when recruited at reporter genes, we annotate 374 activation domains and 715 repression domains, roughly 80\% of which are new and have not been previously annotated3--5. Rational mutagenesis and deletion scans across all the effector domains reveal aromatic and/or leucine residues interspersed with acidic, proline, serine and/or glutamine residues are necessary for activation domain activity. Furthermore, most repression domain sequences contain sites for small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, short interaction motifs for recruiting corepressors or are structured binding domains for recruiting other repressive proteins. We discover bifunctional domains that can both activate and repress, some of which dynamically split a cell population into high- and low-expression subpopulations. Our systematic annotation and characterization of effector domains provide a rich resource for understanding the function of human transcription factors and chromatin regulators, engineering compact tools for controlling gene expression and refining predictive models of effector domain function.},

Although TF binding events on nucleosome-free DNA~are independent, activation domains recruit cofactors that destabilize nucleosomes, driving observed TF binding cooperativity. Average TF occupancy linearly determines promoter activity, and we decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the enhancer binding microstates and gene expression dynamics. This work provides a template for the quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene expression, including TF activation domains, concentration, binding affinity, binding site configuration and recruitment of chromatin regulators.},

To explore the basis for this precision, we conducted a high-throughput analysis of the Otx-a enhancer, which mediates expression in the neural plate of Ciona embryos in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and a localized GATA determinant. We provide evidence that enhancer specificity depends on submaximal recognition motifs having reduced binding affinities (``suboptimization''). Native GATA and ETS (FGF) binding sites contain imperfect matches to consensus motifs. Perfect matches mediate robust but ectopic patterns of gene expression. The native sites are not arranged at optimal intervals, and subtle changes in their spacing alter enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we suggest that clusters of weak enhancers, including certain ``superenhancers,'' circumvent this trade-off in specificity and activity.},

Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin data over a dense time course in human organoids covering neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization and neurogenesis, and identify temporally dynamic and brain-region-specific regulatory regions. We developed Pando---a flexible framework that incorporates multi-omic data and predictions of transcription-factor-binding sites to infer a global gene regulatory network describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoids. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors affect neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the transcription factor GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous research performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify two distinct GLI3 regulomes that are central to telencephalic fate decisions: one regulating dorsoventral patterning with HES4/5 as direct GLI3 targets, and one controlling ganglionic eminence diversification later in development. Together, we provide a framework for how human model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human developmental biology.},

Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs4--8. Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.},

Over the past several decades, many computational methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific frequency matrix.             Results: We describe Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO), a software tool for scanning DNA or protein sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. The program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a P-value and then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequence. FIMO provides output in a variety of formats, including HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of DNA sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single CPU.             Availability and Implementation: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit. A web server and source code are available at http://meme.sdsc.edu.

Here we create and evaluate a resource of {$>$}13 million enhancer-gene regulatory interactions across 352 cell types and tissues, by integrating predictive models, measurements of chromatin state and 3D contacts, and large-scale genetic perturbations generated by the ENCODE Consortium7. We first create a systematic benchmarking pipeline to compare predictive models, assembling a dataset of 10,411 element-gene pairs measured in CRISPR perturbation experiments, {$>$}30,000 fine-mapped eQTLs, and 569 fine-mapped GWAS variants linked to a likely causal gene. Using this framework, we develop a new predictive model, ENCODE-rE2G, that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple prediction tasks, demonstrating a strategy involving iterative perturbations and supervised machine learning to build increasingly accurate predictive models of enhancer regulation. Using the ENCODE-rE2G model, we build an encyclopedia of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in the human genome, which reveals global properties of enhancer networks, identifies differences in the functions of genes that have more or less complex regulatory landscapes, and improves analyses to link noncoding variants to target genes and cell types for common, complex diseases. By interpreting the model, we find evidence that, beyond enhancer activity and 3D enhancer-promoter contacts, additional features guide enhancer-promoter communication including promoter class and enhancer-enhancer synergy. Altogether, these genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, benchmarking software, predictive models, and insights about enhancer function provide a valuable resource for future studies of gene regulation and human genetics.},

The PFH predicts that ectopic gene activation requires the sequential activity of qualitatively different TFs. We tested the PFH by expressing the endodermal PF FOXA1 and non-PF HNF4A in K562 lymphoblast cells. While co-expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A activated a burst of endoderm-specific gene expression, we found no evidence for a functional distinction between these two TFs. When expressed independently, both TFs bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated endodermal genes, and `pioneered' for each other, although FOXA1 required fewer copies of its motif for binding. A subset of targets required both TFs, but the predominant mode of action at these targets did not conform to the sequential activity predicted by the PFH. From these results, we hypothesize an alternative to the PFH where `pioneer activity' depends not on categorically different TFs but rather on the affinity of interaction between TF and DNA.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Joint RNA-seq and epigenomic profiling provides opportunities to build unifying models of gene regulation capturing sequence determinants across steps of gene expression. However, current models, developed primarily for bulk omics data, fail to capture the cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes revealed by single-cell multi-modal technologies. Here, we introduce scooby, the first model to predict scRNA-seq coverage and scATAC-seq insertion profiles along the genome from sequence at single-cell resolution. For this, we leverage the pre-trained multi-omics profile predictor Borzoi as a foundation model, equip it with a cell-specific decoder, and fine-tune its sequence embeddings. Specifically, we condition the decoder on the cell position in a precomputed single-cell embedding resulting in strong generalization capability. Applied to a hematopoiesis dataset, scooby recapitulates cell-specific expression levels of held-out genes and cells, and identifies regulators and their putative target genes through in silico motif deletion. Moreover, accurate variant effect prediction with scooby allows for breaking down bulk eQTL effects into single-cell effects and delineating their impact on chromatin accessibility and gene expression. We anticipate scooby to aid unraveling the complexities of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        The Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) project is a collaborative effort to create a comprehensive catalog of functional elements in the human genome. The current database comprises more than 19000 functional genomics experiments across more than 1000 cell lines and tissues using a wide array of experimental techniques to study the chromatin structure, regulatory and transcriptional landscape of the             Homo sapiens             and             Mus musculus             genomes. All experimental data, metadata, and associated computational analyses created by the ENCODE consortium are submitted to the Data Coordination Center (DCC) for validation, tracking, storage, and distribution to community resources and the scientific community. The ENCODE project has engineered and distributed uniform processing pipelines in order to promote data provenance and reproducibility as well as allow interoperability between genomic resources and other consortia. All data files, reference genome versions, software versions, and parameters used by the pipelines are captured and available             via             the ENCODE Portal. The pipeline code, developed using Docker and Workflow Description Language (WDL;             https://openwdl.org/             ) is publicly available in GitHub, with images available on Dockerhub (             https://hub.docker.com             ), enabling access to a diverse range of biomedical researchers. ENCODE pipelines maintained and used by the DCC can be installed to run on personal computers, local HPC clusters, or in cloud computing environments             via             Cromwell. Access to the pipelines and data             via             the cloud allows small labs the ability to use the data or software without access to institutional compute clusters. Standardization of the computational methodologies for analysis and quality control leads to comparable results from different ENCODE collections - a prerequisite for successful integrative analyses.

Despite considerable success in culturing physiologically relevant organoids, challenges remain to achieve real-life applications. In particular, the high variability of self-organizing growth and restricted experimental and analytical access hamper the translatability of organoid systems. In this Review, we argue that many limitations of traditional organoid culture can be addressed by engineering approaches at all levels of organoid systems. We investigate cell surface and genetic engineering approaches, and discuss stem cell niche engineering based on the design of matrices that allow spatiotemporal control of organoid growth and shape-guided morphogenesis. We examine how microfluidic approaches and lessons learnt from organs-on-a-chip enable the integration of mechano-physiological parameters and increase accessibility of organoids to improve functional readouts. Applying engineering principles to organoids increases reproducibility and provides experimental control, which will, ultimately, be required to enable clinical translation.},

  abstract = {The cranial neural crest (NC) is a migratory embryonic population ideal for studying cell plasticity, motility, and fate establishment. Although NC migration has been linked to changes in cell adhesion, polarity, and signaling, the gene regulatory circuitry governing these processes remained obscure. Using time-resolved single-cell multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics, and gene regulatory network reconstruction, we identified ten programs underlying 23 NC cell states and three spatial trajectories. Using in silico perturbation and systematic CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Perturb-seq, we uncovered novel lineage drivers and an endothelial-like program controlling NC migration, distinct from the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. We show that endothelial-like regulons (fli1a, elk3) drive migration through direct or tiered activation via the ``FOX:ETS-Ebf3a-targets'' axis, while ETS suppressors (erf, erfl3) maintain cell plasticity. Using the newly developed SyncReg tool, we identify functional redundancy among ETS regulons, which has thus far obscured their critical roles in NC migration, and we quantify their synergy with retinoic acid receptors, also essential for this process. Our GRN model, combined with novel velocity-embedded simulations, accurately predicted the functions of all major regulons, which were confirmed by in vivo functional perturbations. This study provides a comprehensive, validated cranial NC regulatory landscape, resolving heterogeneous regulatory circuits underlying NC cell motility and plasticity.},

However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constituent cell types. Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves---all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.},

Pioneer transcription factors can bind DNA sites on nucleosomes and initiate gene regulatory events, often leading to the local opening of chromatin. However, the nucleosomal configuration of open chromatin and the basis for its regulation is unclear. We combined low and high levels of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion along with core histone mapping to assess the nucleosomal configuration at enhancers and promoters in mouse liver. We find that MNase-accessible nucleosomes, bound by transcription factors, are retained more at liver-specific enhancers than at promoters and ubiquitous enhancers. The pioneer factor FoxA displaces linker histone H1, thereby keeping enhancer nucleosomes accessible in chromatin and allowing other liver-specific transcription factors to bind and stimulate transcription. Thus, nucleosomes are not exclusively repressive to gene regulation when they are retained with, and exposed by, pioneer factors.},

However, a gap has remained in understanding how molecular interactions with the nucleosome contribute to the chromatin-opening phenomenon. Here we identified a short {$\alpha$}-helical region, conserved among FOXA pioneer factors, that interacts with core histones and contributes to chromatin opening in vitro. The same domain is involved in chromatin opening in early mouse embryos for normal development. Thus, local opening of chromatin by interactions between pioneer factors and core histones promotes genetic programming.},

Repression is mediated by specialized transcription factors (TFs) that recruit co-repressors (CoRs) to silence transcription, even in the presence of activating cues. However, whether CoRs can dominantly silence all enhancers or display distinct specificities is unclear. In this work, we report that most enhancers in Drosophila can be repressed by only a subset of CoRs, and enhancers classified by CoR sensitivity show distinct chromatin features, function, TF motifs, and binding. Distinct TF motifs render enhancers more resistant or sensitive to specific CoRs, as we demonstrate by motif mutagenesis and addition. These CoR-enhancer compatibilities constitute an additional layer of regulatory specificity that allows differential regulation at close genomic distances and is indicative of distinct mechanisms of transcriptional repression.},

It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

Single-cell transcriptome analysis1--6, three-dimensional morphological classification7 and electron microscopy mapping of the connectome8,9 have revealed an immense diversity of neuronal and glial cell types that underlie an array of functional and behavioural traits in the fly. The identities of these cell types are controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs), involving combinations of transcription factors that bind to genomic enhancers to regulate their target genes. Here, to characterize GRNs at the cell-type level in the fly brain, we profiled the chromatin accessibility of 240,919 single cells spanning 9 developmental timepoints and integrated these data with single-cell transcriptomes. We identify more than 95,000 regulatory regions that are used in different neuronal cell types, of which 70,000 are linked to developmental trajectories involving neurogenesis, reprogramming and maturation. For 40 cell types, uniquely accessible regions were associated with their expressed transcription factors and downstream target genes through a combination of motif discovery, network inference and deep learning, creating enhancer GRNs. The enhancer architectures revealed by DeepFlyBrain lead to a better understanding of neuronal regulatory diversity and can be used to design genetic driver lines for cell types at specific timepoints, facilitating their characterization and manipulation.},

  abstract = {The establishment of the floor plate at the ventral midline of the CNS is dependent on an inductive signaling process mediated by the secreted protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh). To understand molecularly how floor plate induction proceeds we identified a Shh-responsive regulatory element that directs transgene reporter expression to the ventral midline of the CNS and notochord in a Shh-like manner and characterized critical cis-acting sequences regulating this element. Cross-species comparisons narrowed the activity of the Shh floor plate enhancer to an 88-bp sequence within intron 2 of Shh that included highly conserved binding sites matching the consensus for homeodomain, Tbx and Foxa transcription factors. Mutational analysis revealed that the homeodomain and Foxa binding sites are each required for activation of the Shh floor plate enhancer, whereas the Tbx site was required for repression in regions of the CNS where Shhis not normally expressed. We further show that Shh enhancer activity was detected in the mouse node from where the floor plate and notochord precursors derive. Shh reporter expression was restricted to the ventral (mesodermal)layer of the node in a pattern similar to endogenous Shh. X-gal-positive cells emerging from the node were only detected in the notochord lineage, suggesting that the floor plate and notochord arise from distinct precursors in the mouse node.},

We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

  abstract = {Models for predicting phenotypic outcomes from genotypes have important applications to understanding genomic function and improving human health. Here, we develop a machine-learning system to predict cell-type--specific epigenetic and transcriptional profiles in large mammalian genomes from DNA sequence alone. By use of convolutional neural networks, this system identifies promoters and distal regulatory elements and synthesizes their content to make effective gene expression predictions. We show that model predictions for the influence of genomic variants on gene expression align well to causal variants underlying eQTLs in human populations and can be useful for generating mechanistic hypotheses to enable fine mapping of disease loci.},

One mechanism for achieving regulatory specificity is DNA-guided TF cooperativity. Although in~vitro studies suggest that it may be common, examples of such cooperativity remain scarce in cellular contexts. Here, we demonstrate how ``Coordinator,'' a long DNA motif composed of common motifs bound by many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain (HD) TFs, uniquely defines the regulatory regions of embryonic face and limb mesenchyme. Coordinator guides cooperative and selective binding between the bHLH family mesenchymal regulator TWIST1 and a collective of HD factors associated with regional identities in the face and limb. TWIST1 is required for HD binding and open chromatin at Coordinator sites, whereas HD factors stabilize TWIST1 occupancy at Coordinator and titrate it away from HD-independent sites. This cooperativity results in the shared regulation of genes involved in cell-type and positional identities and ultimately shapes facial morphology and evolution.},

However, current state-of-the-art models have been trained largely on bulk expression profiles from healthy tissues or cell lines, and have not learned the properties of precise cell types and states that are captured in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Thus, they lack the ability to perform these tasks at the resolution of specific cell types or states across diverse tissue and disease contexts. To address this gap, we present Decima, a model that predicts the cell type- and condition- specific expression of a gene from its surrounding DNA sequence. Decima is trained on single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from over 22 million cells, and successfully predicts the cell type-specific expression of unseen genes based on their sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate Decima's ability to reveal the cis-regulatory mechanisms driving cell type-specific gene expression and its changes in disease, to predict non-coding variant effects at cell type resolution, and to design regulatory DNA elements with precisely tuned, context-specific functions.},

This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions. TFs likewise underlie many different aspects of human physiology, disease, and variation, highlighting the importance of continued effort to understand TF-mediated gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Enhancers control the location and timing of gene expression and contain the majority of variants associated with disease1--3. The ZRS is arguably the most well-studied vertebrate enhancer and mediates the expression of Shh in the developing limb4. Thirty-one human single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the ZRS are associated with polydactyly4--6. However, how this enhancer encodes tissue-specific activity, and the mechanisms by which SNVs alter the number of digits, are poorly understood. Here we show that the ETS sites within the ZRS are low affinity, and identify a functional ETS site, ETS-A, with extremely low affinity. Two human SNVs and a synthetic variant optimize the binding affinity of ETS-A subtly from 15\% to around 25\% relative to the strongest~ETS binding sequence,~and cause polydactyly with the same penetrance and severity. A greater increase in affinity results in phenotypes that are more penetrant and more severe. Affinity-optimizing SNVs in other ETS sites in the ZRS, as well as in ETS, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), HOX and activator protein\,1 (AP-1) sites within a wide variety of enhancers, cause gain-of-function gene expression. The prevalence of binding sites with suboptimal affinity in enhancers creates a vulnerability in genomes whereby SNVs that optimize affinity, even slightly, can be pathogenic. Searching for affinity-optimizing SNVs in genomes could provide a mechanistic approach to identify causal variants that underlie enhanceropathies.},

On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

Although enhancers have been extensively studied in isolation, a substantial number of genes have more than one simultaneously active enhancer, and it remains unclear how these cooperate to regulate transcription. Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a model, we assay the activities of more than a thousand individual enhancers and about a million enhancer pairs toward housekeeping and developmental core promoters with STARR-seq. We report that housekeeping and developmental enhancers show distinct modes of enhancer-enhancer cooperativity: while housekeeping enhancers are additive such that their combined activity mirrors the sum of their individual activities, developmental enhancers are super-additive and combine multiplicatively. Super-additivity between developmental enhancers is promiscuous and neither depends on the enhancers' endogenous genomic contexts nor on specific transcription factor motif signatures. However, it can be further boosted by Twist and Trl motifs and saturates for the highest levels of enhancer activity. These results have important implications for our understanding of gene regulation in complex multi-enhancer developmental loci and genomically clustered housekeeping genes, providing a rationale to interpret the transcriptional impact of non-coding mutations at different loci.},

The premise of this review is that an understanding of gene regulation---by any transcription factor---requires the dissection of the cis-regulatory elements that they act upon. With this goal in mind, we review the concepts and ideas regarding gene regulation by Hox proteins and apply them to a curated list of directly regulated Hox cis-regulatory elements that have been validated in the literature. Our analysis of the Hox-binding sites within these elements suggests several emerging generalizations. We distinguish between Hox cofactors, proteins that bind DNA cooperatively with Hox proteins and thereby help with DNA-binding site selection, and Hox collaborators, proteins that bind in parallel to Hox-targeted cis-regulatory elements and dictate the sign and strength of gene regulation. Finally, we summarize insights that come from examining five X-ray crystal structures of Hox-cofactor-DNA complexes. Together, these analyses reveal an enormous amount of flexibility into how Hox proteins function to regulate gene expression, perhaps providing an explanation for why these factors have been central players in the evolution of morphological diversity in the animal kingdom.},

We defined 135 clusters and used multiomic measurements to link candidate cis-regulatory elements to gene expression. The number of accessible regions increased both with age and along neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network, we identified putative functional transcription factor-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes. We applied this model to cis-regulatory elements linked to ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism in the Purkinje cell lineage. Finally, by linking disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms to cis-regulatory elements, we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder-related mutations. Our findings provide a more detailed view of key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of brain cell types during the first trimester and a comprehensive reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment.},

Anecdotal evidence has shown that enhancers can combine sub-additively, additively, synergistically, or redundantly. However, it is not clear which of these modes are more frequent in mammalian genomes. Here, we systematically tested how pairs of enhancers activate promoters using a three-way combinatorial reporter assay in mouse embryonic stem cells. By assaying about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations we found that enhancer pairs generally combine near-additively. This behaviour was conserved across seven developmental promoters tested. Surprisingly, these promoters scale the enhancer signals in a non-linear manner that depends on promoter strength. A housekeeping promoter showed an overall different response to enhancer pairs, and a smaller dynamic range. Thus, our data indicate that enhancers mostly act additively, but promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.},

We used high-throughput combinatorial reporter assays to test thousands of CRE-promoter pairs from three Mb-sized genomic regions in mouse cells. This revealed that CREs vary substantially in their promoter compatibility, ranging from striking specificity to broad promiscuity. More than half of the tested CREs exhibit significant promoter selectivity. Housekeeping promoters tend to have similar CRE preferences, but other promoters exhibit a wide diversity of compatibilities. Higher-order transcription factors (TF) motif combinations may account for compatibility. CRE-promoter selectivity does not correlate with looping interactions in the native genomic context, suggesting that chromatin folding and compatibility are two orthogonal mechanisms that confer specificity to gene regulation.},

Leveraging a granular atlas of chromatin accessibility across 81 immune cell types, we asked if a convolutional neural network (CNN) could learn to infer cell type-specific chromatin accessibility solely from regulatory DNA sequences. With a tailored architecture and an ensemble approach to CNN parameter interpretation, we show that our trained network (``AI-TAC'') does so by rediscovering ab initio the binding motifs for known regulators and some unknown ones. Motifs whose importance is learned virtually as functionally important overlap strikingly well with positions determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation for several TFs. AI-TAC establishes a hierarchy of TFs and their interactions that drives lineage specification and also identifies stage-specific interactions, like Pax5/Ebf1 vs. Pax5/Prdm1, or the role of different NF-{$\kappa$}B dimers in different cell types. AI-TAC assigns Spi1/Cebp and Pax5/Ebf1 as the drivers necessary for myeloid and B lineage fates, respectively, but no factors seemed as dominantly required for T cell differentiation, which may represent a fall-back pathway. Mouse-trained AI-TAC can parse human DNA, revealing a strikingly similar ranking of influential TFs and providing additional support that AI-TAC is a generalizable regulatory sequence decoder. Thus, deep learning can reveal the regulatory syntax predictive of the full differentiative complexity of the immune system.},

The resulting organoids have remarkable cell type complexity, architecture and function similar to their in vivo counterparts. In the past five years, human PSC-derived organoids with components of all three germ layers have been generated, resulting in the establishment of a new human model system.

A better understanding of how enhancers work will improve the interpretation of noncoding genome variation and empower the generation of cell type--specific drivers for gene therapy. Here, we explore the combination of deep learning and cross-species chromatin accessibility profiling to build explainable enhancer models. We apply this strategy to decipher the enhancer code in melanoma, a relevant case study owing to the presence of distinct melanoma cell states. We trained and validated a deep learning model, called DeepMEL, using chromatin accessibility data of 26 melanoma samples across six different species. We show the accuracy of DeepMEL predictions on the CAGI5 challenge, where it significantly outperforms existing models on the melanoma enhancer of IRF4. Next, we exploit DeepMEL to analyze enhancer architectures and identify accurate transcription factor binding sites for the core regulatory complexes in the two different melanoma states, with distinct roles for each transcription factor, in terms of nucleosome displacement or enhancer activation. Finally, DeepMEL identifies orthologous enhancers across distantly related species, where sequence alignment fails, and the model highlights specific nucleotide substitutions that underlie enhancer turnover. DeepMEL can be used from the Kipoi database to predict and optimize candidate enhancers and to prioritize enhancer mutations. In addition, our computational strategy can be applied to other cancer or normal cell types.},

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained our model on the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of {$\sim$}500,000 constructs tiling 15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. MPRA-DragoNN predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman {$\rho$} = 0.28) with measured activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of our model to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced.},

High-affinity motifs that allow for heterotypic TF co-binding and are concentrated at the center of REs buffer against quantitative changes in TF dosage and predict unperturbed accessibility. Conversely, low-affinity or homotypic binding motifs distributed throughout REs drive sensitive responses with minimal impact on unperturbed accessibility. Both buffering and sensitizing features display purifying selection signatures. We validated these sequence features through reporter assays and demonstrated that TF-nucleosome competition can explain low-affinity motifs' sensitizing effects. This combination of transfer learning and quantitative chromatin response measurements provides a novel approach for uncovering additional layers of the cis-regulatory code.},

They nonetheless produce patterns of gene expression that are the same as or similar to those produced by more proximal primary enhancers. It was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations [2, 3]. We critically tested this hypothesis by employing a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering and quantitative confocal imaging methods [2, 4]. Evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by~a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus. Removal of the proximal primary enhancer does not significantly perturb snail function, including the repression of neurogenic genes and formation of the ventral furrow during gastrulation at normal temperatures. However, at elevated temperatures, there is sporadic loss of snail expression and coincident disruptions in gastrulation. Similar defects are observed at normal temperatures upon reductions in the levels of Dorsal, a key activator of snail expression (reviewed in [5]). These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes ``bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions'' [6].},

This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and 93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory `grammar' to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50\% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models. We have made the source code available at the github repository http://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional organoid constructs serve as increasingly widespread in vitro models for development and disease modeling. Current approaches to recreate morphogenetic processes in vitro rely on poorly controllable and ill-defined matrices, thereby largely overlooking the contribution of biochemical and biophysical extracellular matrix (ECM) factors in promoting multicellular growth and reorganization. Here, we show how defined synthetic matrices can be used to explore the role of the ECM in the development of complex 3D neuroepithelial cysts that recapitulate key steps in early neurogenesis. We demonstrate how key ECM parameters are involved in specifying cytoskeleton-mediated symmetry-breaking events that ultimately lead to neural tube-like patterning along the dorsal--ventral (DV) axis. Such synthetic materials serve as valuable tools for studying the discrete action of extrinsic factors in organogenesis, and allow for the discovery of relationships between cytoskeletal mechanobiology and morphogenesis.},

  abstract = {Cell fate commitment involves the progressive restriction of developmental potential. Recent studies have shown that this process requires not only shifts in gene expression but also an extensive remodeling of the epigenomic landscape. To examine how chromatin states are reorganized during cellular specification in an in vivo system, we examined the function of pioneer factor TFAP2A at discrete stages of neural crest development. Our results show that TFAP2A activates distinct sets of genomic regions during induction of the neural plate border and specification of neural crest cells. Genomic occupancy analysis revealed that the repertoire of TFAP2A targets depends upon its dimerization with paralogous proteins TFAP2C and TFAP2B. During gastrula stages, TFAP2A/C heterodimers activate components of the neural plate border induction program. As neurulation begins, TFAP2A trades partners, and TFAP2A/B heterodimers reorganize the epigenomic landscape of progenitor cells to promote neural crest specification. We propose that this molecular switch acts to drive progressive cell commitment, remodeling the epigenomic landscape to define the presumptive neural crest. Our findings show how pioneer factors regulate distinct genomic targets in a stage-specific manner and highlight how paralogy can serve as an evolutionary strategy to diversify the function of the regulators that control embryonic development.},

During development, these different types of neurons differentiate from transcriptionally distinct neural progenitors that are arrayed in discrete domains along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes of the embryonic spinal cord. This organization arises in response to morphogen gradients acting upstream of a gene regulatory network, the architecture of which determines the spatial and temporal pattern of gene expression. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in deciphering the regulatory network that underlies the specification of distinct progenitor and neuronal cell identities. In this Review, we outline how distinct neuronal cell identities are established in response to spatial and temporal patterning systems, and outline novel experimental approaches to study the emergence and function of neuronal diversity in the spinal cord.},

Neural tissues derived from pluripotent stem cells in vitro (neural organoids) provide new models for studying neural regionalization, however, we lack a comprehensive survey of how the developing human neuroepithelium responds to morphogen cues. Here, we produce a detailed map of morphogen-induced effects on the axial and regional specification of human neural organoids using a multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics screen. We find that the timing, concentration, and combination of morphogens strongly influence organoid cell type and regional composition, and that cell line and neural induction method strongly impact the response to a given morphogen condition. We apply concentration gradients in microfluidic chips or a range of static concentrations in multi-well plates to explore how human neuroepithelium interprets morphogen concentrations and observe similar dose-dependent induction of patterned domains in both scenarios. Altogether, we provide a detailed resource that supports the development of new regionalized neural organoid protocols and enhances our understanding of human central nervous system patterning.},

These efforts have relied on studies of organ assembly during embryonic development and have resulted in the development of organoids with multilayer tissue complexity and higher-order functions. We discuss how the next generation of organoids can be designed by means of an engineering-based narrative design to control patterning, assembly, morphogenesis, growth, and function.},

It has been a long-standing goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Here we show that deep learning models2--6, can be used to efficiently design synthetic, cell-type-specific enhancers, starting from random sequences, and that this optimization process allows detailed tracing of enhancer features at single-nucleotide resolution. We evaluate the function of fully synthetic enhancers to specifically target Kenyon cells or glial cells in the fruit fly brain using transgenic animals. We further exploit enhancer design to create `dual-code' enhancers that target two cell types and minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully functional. By examining the state space searches towards local optima, we characterize enhancer codes through the strength, combination and arrangement of transcription factor activator and transcription factor repressor motifs. Finally, we apply the same strategies to successfully design human enhancers, which adhere to enhancer rules similar to those of Drosophila enhancers. Enhancer design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to manipulate cell states.},

Furthermore, synergy between two enhancer elements depends on the distance at which the two elements are integrated: introducing a weak enhancer between a strong enhancer and the promoter strongly increases reporter gene expression, allowing enhancers to activate from increased genomic distances.},

Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients.

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

Single-cell technology helps not only locate cells on this landscape, but illuminates the molecular mechanisms that shape the landscape itself.

We also map context dependencies of effectors drawn from unannotated protein regions using a larger library tiling chromatin regulators and transcription factors. We find that many effectors depend on target and DBD contexts, such as HLH domains that can act as either activators or repressors. To enable efficient perturbations, we select context-robust domains, including ZNF705 KRAB, that improve CRISPRi tools to silence promoters and enhancers. We engineer a compact human activator called NFZ, by combining NCOA3, FOXO3 and ZNF473 domains, which enables efficient CRISPRa with better viral delivery and inducible control of chimeric antigen receptor T cells.},

To fill this void, we utilize comparative genome analysis to identify candidate enhancer elements in the human genome coupled with the experimental determination of their in vivo enhancer activity in transgenic mice [L. A. Pennacchio et al. (2006) Nature, in press]. These data are available through the VISTA Enhancer Browser (http://enhancer.lbl.gov). This growing database currently contains over 250 experimentally tested DNA fragments, of which more than 100 have been validated as tissue-specific enhancers. For each positive enhancer, we provide digital images of whole-mount embryo staining at embryonic day 11.5 and an anatomical description of the reporter gene expression pattern. Users can retrieve elements near single genes of interest, search for enhancers that target reporter gene expression to a particular tissue, or download entire collections of enhancers with a defined tissue specificity or conservation depth. These experimentally validated training sets are expected to provide a basis for a wide range of downstream computational and functional studies of enhancer function.},

  abstract = {Human stem cells can generate complex, multicellular epithelial tissues of endodermal origin in vitro that recapitulate aspects of developing and adult human physiology. These tissues, also called organoids, can be derived from pluripotent stem cells or tissue-resident fetal and adult stem cells. However, it has remained difficult to understand the precision and accuracy of organoid cell states through comparison with primary counterparts, and to comprehensively assess the similarity and differences between organoid protocols. Advances in computational single-cell biology now allow the integration of datasets with high technical variability. Here, we integrate single-cell transcriptomes from 218 samples covering organoids of diverse endoderm-derived tissues including lung, pancreas, intestine, liver, biliary system, stomach, and prostate to establish an initial version of a human endoderm organoid cell atlas (HEOCA). The integration includes nearly one million cells across diverse conditions, data sources and protocols. We align and compare cell types and states between organoid models, and harmonize cell type annotations by mapping the atlas to primary tissue counterparts. To demonstrate utility of the atlas, we focus on intestine and lung, and clarify ontogenic cell states that can be modeled in vitro. We further provide examples of mapping novel data from new organoid protocols to expand the atlas, and showcase how integrating organoid models of disease into the HEOCA identifies altered cell proportions and states between healthy and disease conditions. The atlas makes diverse datasets centrally available, and will be valuable to assess organoid fidelity, characterize perturbed and diseased states, and streamline protocol development.},

Here, we apply iterative deep learning to design synthetic enhancers with strong differential activity between two human cell lines. We initially train models on published datasets of enhancer activity and chromatin accessibility and use them to guide the design of synthetic enhancers that maximize predicted specificity. We experimentally validate these sequences, use the measurements to re-optimize the predictor, and design a second generation of enhancers with improved specificity. Our design methods embed relevant transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs with higher frequencies than comparable endogenous enhancers while using a more selective motif vocabulary, and we show that enhancer activity is correlated with transcription factor expression at the single cell level. Finally, we characterize causal features of top enhancers via perturbation experiments and show enhancers as short as 50bp can maintain specificity.},

We capture transitions from pluripotency through neuroepithelium to retinal and brain region and cell type specification. Switching of repressive and activating epigenetic modifications can precede and predict cell fate decisions at each stage, providing a temporal census of gene regulatory elements and transcription factors.

While the role of spatial patterning in organising cell fate specification has been extensively studied, temporal patterning, which controls the timing of cell type generation, is equally important. Here we define a global temporal programme operating in progenitors throughout the vertebrate nervous systems that governs cell fate choices by regulating chromatin accessibility. Perturbation of this cis-regulatory programme affects sequential cell fate transitions in neural progenitors and the identity of their progeny. The temporal programme operates in parallel to spatial patterning, ensuring the timely availability of regulatory elements for spatial determinants to direct cell-type specific gene expression. These findings identify a chronotopic spatiotemporal integration strategy in which a global temporal chromatin programme determines the output of a spatial gene regulatory network resulting in the temporally and spatially ordered allocation of cell type identity.},

  abstract = {Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)1--4. However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer--promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation.},
