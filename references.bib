  abstract = {Summary: A motif is a short DNA or protein sequence that
              contributes to the biological function of the sequence in which it
              resides. Over the past several decades, many computational methods
              have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching
              with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based sequence
              analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for
              occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific
              frequency matrix.Results: We describe Find Individual Motif
              Occurrences (FIMO), a software tool for scanning DNA or protein
              sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring
              matrices. The program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for
              each position in a given sequence database, uses established
              dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a P-value and
              then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value
              for each position in the given sequence. FIMO provides output in a
              variety of formats, including HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz
              Genome Browser formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the
              scanning of DNA sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single
              CPU.Availability and Implementation: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite
              software toolkit. A web server and source code are available at
              http://meme.sdsc.edu.Contact: t.bailey@imb.uq.edu.au;
