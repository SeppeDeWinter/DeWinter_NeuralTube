  abstract = {Tissues achieve their complex spatial organization through an interplay between gene regulatory networks, cell-cell communication, and physical interactions mediated by mechanical forces. Current strategies to generate in-vitro tissues have largely failed to implement such active, dynamically coordinated mechanical manipulations, relying instead on extracellular matrices which respond to, rather than impose mechanical forces. Here, we develop devices that enable the actuation of organoids. We show that active mechanical forces increase growth and lead to enhanced patterning in an organoid model of the neural tube derived from single human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). Using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that organoid mechanoregulation due to actuation operates in a temporally restricted competence window, and that organoid response to stretch is mediated extracellularly by matrix stiffness and intracellularly by cytoskeleton contractility and planar cell polarity. Exerting active mechanical forces on organoids using the approaches developed here is widely applicable and should enable the generation of more reproducible, programmable organoid shape, identity and patterns, opening avenues for the use of these tools in regenerative medicine and disease modelling applications.},

  abstract = {Genomic sequence variation within enhancers and promoters can have a significant impact on the cellular state and phenotype. However, sifting through the millions of candidate variants in a personal genome or a cancer genome, to identify those that impact cis-regulatory function, remains a major challenge. Interpretation of noncoding genome variation benefits from explainable artificial intelligence to predict and interpret the impact of a mutation on gene regulation. Here we generate phased whole genomes with matched chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression for 10 melanoma cell lines. We find that training a specialized deep learning model, called DeepMEL2, on melanoma chromatin accessibility data can capture the various regulatory programs of the melanocytic and mesenchymal-like melanoma cell states. This model outperforms motif-based variant scoring, as well as more generic deep learning models. We detect hundreds to thousands of allele-specific chromatin accessibility variants (ASCAVs) in each melanoma genome, of which 15\%--20\% can be explained by gains or losses of transcription factor binding sites. A considerable fraction of ASCAVs are caused by changes in AP-1 binding, as confirmed by matched ChIP-seq data to identify allele-specific binding of JUN and FOSL1. Finally, by augmenting the DeepMEL2 model with ChIP-seq data for GABPA, the TERT promoter mutation, as well as additional ETS motif gains, can be identified with high confidence. In conclusion, we present a new integrative genomics approach and a deep learning model to identify and interpret functional enhancer mutations with allelic imbalance of chromatin accessibility and gene expression.},

However, it is unclear whether this spatial variation, called zonation, is governed by a well-defined gene regulatory code. Here, using a combination of single-cell multiomics, spatial omics, massively parallel reporter assays and deep learning, we mapped enhancer-gene regulatory networks across mouse liver cell types. We found that zonation affects gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes, among other cell types. These states are driven by the repressors TCF7L1 and TBX3, alongside other core hepatocyte transcription factors, such as HNF4A, CEBPA, FOXA1 and ONECUT1. To examine the architecture of the enhancers driving these cell states, we trained a hierarchical deep learning model called DeepLiver. Our study provides a multimodal understanding of the regulatory code underlying hepatocyte identity and their zonation state that can be used to engineer enhancers with specific activity levels and zonation patterns.},

These distinctive attributes have inspired the curiosity of developmental biologists for over 150 years, however only recently the regulatory mechanisms controlling the complex features of the NC have started to become elucidated at genomic scales. Regulatory control of NC development is achieved through combinatorial transcription factor binding and recruitment of associated transcriptional complexes to distal cis-regulatory elements. Together, they regulate when, where and to what extent transcriptional programmes are actively deployed, ultimately shaping ontogenetic processes. Here, we discuss how transcriptional networks control NC ontogeny, with a special emphasis on the molecular mechanisms underlying specification of the cephalic NC. We also cover emerging properties of transcriptional regulation revealed in diverse developmental systems, such as the role of three-dimensional conformation of chromatin, and how they are involved in the regulation of NC ontogeny. Finally, we highlight how advances in deciphering the NC transcriptional network have afforded new insights into the molecular basis of human diseases.},

The `cis-regulatory code' --- how cells interpret DNA sequences to determine when, where and how much genes should be expressed --- has proven to be exceedingly complex. Recently, advances in the scale and resolution of functional genomics assays and machine learning have enabled substantial progress towards deciphering this code. However, the cis-regulatory code will probably never be solved if models are trained only on genomic sequences; regions of homology can easily lead to overestimation of predictive performance, and our genome is too short and has insufficient sequence diversity to learn all relevant parameters. Fortunately, randomly synthesized DNA sequences enable testing a far larger sequence space than exists in our genomes, and designed DNA sequences enable targeted queries to maximally improve the models. As the same biochemical principles are used to interpret DNA regardless of its source, models trained on these synthetic data can predict genomic activity, often better than genome-trained models. Here we provide an outlook on the field, and propose a roadmap towards solving the cis-regulatory code by a combination of machine learning and massively parallel assays using synthetic DNA.},

To explore the basis for this precision, we conducted a high-throughput analysis of the Otx-a enhancer, which mediates expression in the neural plate of Ciona embryos in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and a localized GATA determinant. We provide evidence that enhancer specificity depends on submaximal recognition motifs having reduced binding affinities (``suboptimization''). Native GATA and ETS (FGF) binding sites contain imperfect matches to consensus motifs. Perfect matches mediate robust but ectopic patterns of gene expression. The native sites are not arranged at optimal intervals, and subtle changes in their spacing alter enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we suggest that clusters of weak enhancers, including certain ``superenhancers,'' circumvent this trade-off in specificity and activity.},

  abstract = {Self-organizing neural organoids grown from pluripotent stem cells1--3 combined with single-cell genomic technologies provide opportunities to examine gene regulatory networks underlying human brain development. Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin data over a dense time course in human organoids covering neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization and neurogenesis, and identify temporally dynamic and brain-region-specific regulatory regions. We developed Pando---a flexible framework that incorporates multi-omic data and predictions of transcription-factor-binding sites to infer a global gene regulatory network describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoids. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors affect neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the transcription factor GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous research performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify two distinct GLI3 regulomes that are central to telencephalic fate decisions: one regulating dorsoventral patterning with HES4/5 as direct GLI3 targets, and one controlling ganglionic eminence diversification later in development. Together, we provide a framework for how human model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human developmental biology.},

Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs4--8. Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.},

The PFH predicts that ectopic gene activation requires the sequential activity of qualitatively different TFs. We tested the PFH by expressing the endodermal PF FOXA1 and non-PF HNF4A in K562 lymphoblast cells. While co-expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A activated a burst of endoderm-specific gene expression, we found no evidence for a functional distinction between these two TFs. When expressed independently, both TFs bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated endodermal genes, and `pioneered' for each other, although FOXA1 required fewer copies of its motif for binding. A subset of targets required both TFs, but the predominant mode of action at these targets did not conform to the sequential activity predicted by the PFH. From these results, we hypothesize an alternative to the PFH where `pioneer activity' depends not on categorically different TFs but rather on the affinity of interaction between TF and DNA.},

Finally, we show that the atlas can be used as a diverse control cohort to annotate and compare organoid models of neural disease, identifying genes and pathways that may underlie pathological mechanisms with the neural models.

In particular, the high variability of self-organizing growth and restricted experimental and analytical access hamper the translatability of organoid systems. In this Review, we argue that many limitations of traditional organoid culture can be addressed by engineering approaches at all levels of organoid systems. We investigate cell surface and genetic engineering approaches, and discuss stem cell niche engineering based on the design of matrices that allow spatiotemporal control of organoid growth and shape-guided morphogenesis. We examine how microfluidic approaches and lessons learnt from organs-on-a-chip enable the integration of mechano-physiological parameters and increase accessibility of organoids to improve functional readouts. Applying engineering principles to organoids increases reproducibility and provides experimental control, which will, ultimately, be required to enable clinical translation.},

  abstract = {The cranial neural crest (NC) is a migratory embryonic population ideal for studying cell plasticity, motility, and fate establishment. Although NC migration has been linked to changes in cell adhesion, polarity, and signaling, the gene regulatory circuitry governing these processes remained obscure. Using time-resolved single-cell multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics, and gene regulatory network reconstruction, we identified ten programs underlying 23 NC cell states and three spatial trajectories. Using in silico perturbation and systematic CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Perturb-seq, we uncovered novel lineage drivers and an endothelial-like program controlling NC migration, distinct from the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. We show that endothelial-like regulons (fli1a, elk3) drive migration through direct or tiered activation via the ``FOX:ETS-Ebf3a-targets'' axis, while ETS suppressors (erf, erfl3) maintain cell plasticity. Using the newly developed SyncReg tool, we identify functional redundancy among ETS regulons, which has thus far obscured their critical roles in NC migration, and we quantify their synergy with retinoic acid receptors, also essential for this process. Our GRN model, combined with novel velocity-embedded simulations, accurately predicted the functions of all major regulons, which were confirmed by in vivo functional perturbations. This study provides a comprehensive, validated cranial NC regulatory landscape, resolving heterogeneous regulatory circuits underlying NC cell motility and plasticity.},

Pioneer transcription factors can bind DNA sites on nucleosomes and initiate gene regulatory events, often leading to the local opening of chromatin. However, the nucleosomal configuration of open chromatin and the basis for its regulation is unclear. We combined low and high levels of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion along with core histone mapping to assess the nucleosomal configuration at enhancers and promoters in mouse liver. We find that MNase-accessible nucleosomes, bound by transcription factors, are retained more at liver-specific enhancers than at promoters and ubiquitous enhancers. The pioneer factor FoxA displaces linker histone H1, thereby keeping enhancer nucleosomes accessible in chromatin and allowing other liver-specific transcription factors to bind and stimulate transcription. Thus, nucleosomes are not exclusively repressive to gene regulation when they are retained with, and exposed by, pioneer factors.},

Single-cell transcriptome analysis1--6, three-dimensional morphological classification7 and electron microscopy mapping of the connectome8,9 have revealed an immense diversity of neuronal and glial cell types that underlie an array of functional and behavioural traits in the fly. The identities of these cell types are controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs), involving combinations of transcription factors that bind to genomic enhancers to regulate their target genes. Here, to characterize GRNs at the cell-type level in the fly brain, we profiled the chromatin accessibility of 240,919 single cells spanning 9 developmental timepoints and integrated these data with single-cell transcriptomes. We identify more than 95,000 regulatory regions that are used in different neuronal cell types, of which 70,000 are linked to developmental trajectories involving neurogenesis, reprogramming and maturation. For 40 cell types, uniquely accessible regions were associated with their expressed transcription factors and downstream target genes through a combination of motif discovery, network inference and deep learning, creating enhancer GRNs. The enhancer architectures revealed by DeepFlyBrain lead to a better understanding of neuronal regulatory diversity and can be used to design genetic driver lines for cell types at specific timepoints, facilitating their characterization and manipulation.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) can define distinct cellular identities despite nearly identical DNA-binding specificities. One mechanism for achieving regulatory specificity is DNA-guided TF cooperativity. Although in~vitro studies suggest that it may be common, examples of such cooperativity remain scarce in cellular contexts. Here, we demonstrate how ``Coordinator,'' a long DNA motif composed of common motifs bound by many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain (HD) TFs, uniquely defines the regulatory regions of embryonic face and limb mesenchyme. Coordinator guides cooperative and selective binding between the bHLH family mesenchymal regulator TWIST1 and a collective of HD factors associated with regional identities in the face and limb. TWIST1 is required for HD binding and open chromatin at Coordinator sites, whereas HD factors stabilize TWIST1 occupancy at Coordinator and titrate it away from HD-independent sites. This cooperativity results in the shared regulation of genes involved in cell-type and positional identities and ultimately shapes facial morphology and evolution.},

Despite keen interest in understanding how TFs control gene expression, it remains challenging to determine how the precise genomic binding sites of TFs are specified and how TF binding ultimately relates to regulation of transcription. This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions. TFs likewise underlie many different aspects of human physiology, disease, and variation, highlighting the importance of continued effort to understand TF-mediated gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Enhancers control the location and timing of gene expression and contain the majority of variants associated with disease1--3. The ZRS is arguably the most well-studied vertebrate enhancer and mediates the expression of Shh in the developing limb4. Thirty-one human single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the ZRS are associated with polydactyly4--6. However, how this enhancer encodes tissue-specific activity, and the mechanisms by which SNVs alter the number of digits, are poorly understood. Here we show that the ETS sites within the ZRS are low affinity, and identify a functional ETS site, ETS-A, with extremely low affinity. Two human SNVs and a synthetic variant optimize the binding affinity of ETS-A subtly from 15\% to around 25\% relative to the strongest~ETS binding sequence,~and cause polydactyly with the same penetrance and severity. A greater increase in affinity results in phenotypes that are more penetrant and more severe. Affinity-optimizing SNVs in other ETS sites in the ZRS, as well as in ETS, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), HOX and activator protein\,1 (AP-1) sites within a wide variety of enhancers, cause gain-of-function gene expression. The prevalence of binding sites with suboptimal affinity in enhancers creates a vulnerability in genomes whereby SNVs that optimize affinity, even slightly, can be pathogenic. Searching for affinity-optimizing SNVs in genomes could provide a mechanistic approach to identify causal variants that underlie enhanceropathies.},

The premise of this review is that an understanding of gene regulation---by any transcription factor---requires the dissection of the cis-regulatory elements that they act upon. With this goal in mind, we review the concepts and ideas regarding gene regulation by Hox proteins and apply them to a curated list of directly regulated Hox cis-regulatory elements that have been validated in the literature. Our analysis of the Hox-binding sites within these elements suggests several emerging generalizations. We distinguish between Hox cofactors, proteins that bind DNA cooperatively with Hox proteins and thereby help with DNA-binding site selection, and Hox collaborators, proteins that bind in parallel to Hox-targeted cis-regulatory elements and dictate the sign and strength of gene regulation. Finally, we summarize insights that come from examining five X-ray crystal structures of Hox-cofactor-DNA complexes. Together, these analyses reveal an enormous amount of flexibility into how Hox proteins function to regulate gene expression, perhaps providing an explanation for why these factors have been central players in the evolution of morphological diversity in the animal kingdom.},

Although gene expression across the developing brain has been described at single-cell resolution1, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain2--4. Here we describe chromatin accessibility and paired gene expression across the entire developing human brain during the first trimester (6--13 weeks after conception). We defined 135 clusters and used multiomic measurements to link candidate cis-regulatory elements to gene expression. The number of accessible regions increased both with age and along neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network, we identified putative functional transcription factor-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes. We applied this model to cis-regulatory elements linked to ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism in the Purkinje cell lineage. Finally, by linking disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms to cis-regulatory elements, we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder-related mutations. Our findings provide a more detailed view of key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of brain cell types during the first trimester and a comprehensive reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment.},

Leveraging a granular atlas of chromatin accessibility across 81 immune cell types, we asked if a convolutional neural network (CNN) could learn to infer cell type-specific chromatin accessibility solely from regulatory DNA sequences. With a tailored architecture and an ensemble approach to CNN parameter interpretation, we show that our trained network (``AI-TAC'') does so by rediscovering ab initio the binding motifs for known regulators and some unknown ones. Motifs whose importance is learned virtually as functionally important overlap strikingly well with positions determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation for several TFs. AI-TAC establishes a hierarchy of TFs and their interactions that drives lineage specification and also identifies stage-specific interactions, like Pax5/Ebf1 vs. Pax5/Prdm1, or the role of different NF-{$\kappa$}B dimers in different cell types. AI-TAC assigns Spi1/Cebp and Pax5/Ebf1 as the drivers necessary for myeloid and B lineage fates, respectively, but no factors seemed as dominantly required for T cell differentiation, which may represent a fall-back pathway. Mouse-trained AI-TAC can parse human DNA, revealing a strikingly similar ranking of influential TFs and providing additional support that AI-TAC is a generalizable regulatory sequence decoder. Thus, deep learning can reveal the regulatory syntax predictive of the full differentiative complexity of the immune system.},

A better understanding of how enhancers work will improve the interpretation of noncoding genome variation and empower the generation of cell type--specific drivers for gene therapy. Here, we explore the combination of deep learning and cross-species chromatin accessibility profiling to build explainable enhancer models. We apply this strategy to decipher the enhancer code in melanoma, a relevant case study owing to the presence of distinct melanoma cell states. We trained and validated a deep learning model, called DeepMEL, using chromatin accessibility data of 26 melanoma samples across six different species. We show the accuracy of DeepMEL predictions on the CAGI5 challenge, where it significantly outperforms existing models on the melanoma enhancer of IRF4. Next, we exploit DeepMEL to analyze enhancer architectures and identify accurate transcription factor binding sites for the core regulatory complexes in the two different melanoma states, with distinct roles for each transcription factor, in terms of nucleosome displacement or enhancer activation. Finally, DeepMEL identifies orthologous enhancers across distantly related species, where sequence alignment fails, and the model highlights specific nucleotide substitutions that underlie enhancer turnover. DeepMEL can be used from the Kipoi database to predict and optimize candidate enhancers and to prioritize enhancer mutations. In addition, our computational strategy can be applied to other cancer or normal cell types.},

High-affinity motifs that allow for heterotypic TF co-binding and are concentrated at the center of REs buffer against quantitative changes in TF dosage and predict unperturbed accessibility. Conversely, low-affinity or homotypic binding motifs distributed throughout REs drive sensitive responses with minimal impact on unperturbed accessibility. Both buffering and sensitizing features display purifying selection signatures. We validated these sequence features through reporter assays and demonstrated that TF-nucleosome competition can explain low-affinity motifs' sensitizing effects. This combination of transfer learning and quantitative chromatin response measurements provides a novel approach for uncovering additional layers of the cis-regulatory code.},

Recent studies have shown that this process requires not only shifts in gene expression but also an extensive remodeling of the epigenomic landscape. To examine how chromatin states are reorganized during cellular specification in an in vivo system, we examined the function of pioneer factor TFAP2A at discrete stages of neural crest development. Our results show that TFAP2A activates distinct sets of genomic regions during induction of the neural plate border and specification of neural crest cells. Genomic occupancy analysis revealed that the repertoire of TFAP2A targets depends upon its dimerization with paralogous proteins TFAP2C and TFAP2B. During gastrula stages, TFAP2A/C heterodimers activate components of the neural plate border induction program. As neurulation begins, TFAP2A trades partners, and TFAP2A/B heterodimers reorganize the epigenomic landscape of progenitor cells to promote neural crest specification. We propose that this molecular switch acts to drive progressive cell commitment, remodeling the epigenomic landscape to define the presumptive neural crest. Our findings show how pioneer factors regulate distinct genomic targets in a stage-specific manner and highlight how paralogy can serve as an evolutionary strategy to diversify the function of the regulators that control embryonic development.},

We find that the timing, concentration, and combination of morphogens strongly influence organoid cell type and regional composition, and that cell line and neural induction method strongly impact the response to a given morphogen condition. We apply concentration gradients in microfluidic chips or a range of static concentrations in multi-well plates to explore how human neuroepithelium interprets morphogen concentrations and observe similar dose-dependent induction of patterned domains in both scenarios.

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers act as docking stations for combinations of transcription factors and thereby regulate spatiotemporal activation of their target genes1. It has been a long-standing goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Here we show that deep learning models2--6, can be used to efficiently design synthetic, cell-type-specific enhancers, starting from random sequences, and that this optimization process allows detailed tracing of enhancer features at single-nucleotide resolution. We evaluate the function of fully synthetic enhancers to specifically target Kenyon cells or glial cells in the fruit fly brain using transgenic animals. We further exploit enhancer design to create `dual-code' enhancers that target two cell types and minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully functional. By examining the state space searches towards local optima, we characterize enhancer codes through the strength, combination and arrangement of transcription factor activator and transcription factor repressor motifs. Finally, we apply the same strategies to successfully design human enhancers, which adhere to enhancer rules similar to those of Drosophila enhancers. Enhancer design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to manipulate cell states.},

  abstract = {A revolution in cellular measurement technology is under way: For the first time, we have the ability to monitor global gene regulation in thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. Such experiments will allow us to discover new cell types and states and trace their developmental origins. They overcome fundamental limitations inherent in measurements of bulk cell population that have frustrated efforts to resolve cellular states. Single-cell genomics and proteomics enable not only precise characterization of cell state, but also provide a stunningly high-resolution view of transitions between states. These measurements may finally make explicit the metaphor that C.H. Waddington posed nearly 60 years ago to explain cellular plasticity: Cells are residents of a vast ``landscape'' of possible states, over which they travel during development and in disease. Single-cell technology helps not only locate cells on this landscape, but illuminates the molecular mechanisms that shape the landscape itself. However, single-cell genomics is a field in its infancy, with many experimental and computational advances needed to fully realize its full potential.},

  abstract = {Human stem cells can generate complex, multicellular epithelial tissues of endodermal origin in vitro that recapitulate aspects of developing and adult human physiology. These tissues, also called organoids, can be derived from pluripotent stem cells or tissue-resident fetal and adult stem cells. However, it has remained difficult to understand the precision and accuracy of organoid cell states through comparison with primary counterparts, and to comprehensively assess the similarity and differences between organoid protocols. Advances in computational single-cell biology now allow the integration of datasets with high technical variability. Here, we integrate single-cell transcriptomes from 218 samples covering organoids of diverse endoderm-derived tissues including lung, pancreas, intestine, liver, biliary system, stomach, and prostate to establish an initial version of a human endoderm organoid cell atlas (HEOCA). The integration includes nearly one million cells across diverse conditions, data sources and protocols. We align and compare cell types and states between organoid models, and harmonize cell type annotations by mapping the atlas to primary tissue counterparts. To demonstrate utility of the atlas, we focus on intestine and lung, and clarify ontogenic cell states that can be modeled in vitro. We further provide examples of mapping novel data from new organoid protocols to expand the atlas, and showcase how integrating organoid models of disease into the HEOCA identifies altered cell proportions and states between healthy and disease conditions. The atlas makes diverse datasets centrally available, and will be valuable to assess organoid fidelity, characterize perturbed and diseased states, and streamline protocol development.},

  abstract = {Summary           An important and largely unsolved problem in synthetic biology is how to target gene expression to specific cell types. Here, we apply iterative deep learning to design synthetic enhancers with strong differential activity between two human cell lines. We initially train models on published datasets of enhancer activity and chromatin accessibility and use them to guide the design of synthetic enhancers that maximize predicted specificity. We experimentally validate these sequences, use the measurements to re-optimize the predictor, and design a second generation of enhancers with improved specificity. Our design methods embed relevant transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs with higher frequencies than comparable endogenous enhancers while using a more selective motif vocabulary, and we show that enhancer activity is correlated with transcription factor expression at the single cell level. Finally, we characterize causal features of top enhancers via perturbation experiments and show enhancers as short as 50bp can maintain specificity.},

They offer a unique opportunity to develop powerful machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, to uncover the rules of the cis-regulatory code. However, current modeling assumptions are often not based on state-of-the-art knowledge of the cis-regulatory code from transcription, developmental genetics, imaging, and structural studies. Here I aim to fill this gap by giving a brief historical overview of the field, describing common misconceptions and providing knowledge that might help to guide computational approaches. I will describe the principles and mechanisms involved in the combinatorial requirement of transcription factor binding motifs for enhancer activity, including the role of chromatin accessibility, repressors, and low-affinity motifs in the cis-regulatory code. Deciphering the cis-regulatory code would unlock an enormous amount of regulatory information in the genome and would allow us to locate cis-regulatory genetic variants involved in development and disease.},

  abstract = {Cell fate progression of pluripotent progenitors is strictly regulated, resulting in high human cell diversity. Epigenetic modifications also orchestrate cell fate restriction. Unveiling the epigenetic mechanisms underlying human cell diversity has been difficult. In this study, we use human brain and retina organoid models and present single-cell profiling of H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone modifications from progenitor to differentiated neural fates to reconstruct the epigenomic trajectories regulating cell identity acquisition. We capture transitions from pluripotency through neuroepithelium to retinal and brain region and cell type specification. Switching of repressive and activating epigenetic modifications can precede and predict cell fate decisions at each stage, providing a temporal census of gene regulatory elements and transcription factors. Removing H3K27me3 at the neuroectoderm stage disrupts fate restriction, resulting in aberrant cell identity acquisition. Our single-cell epigenome-wide map of human neural organoid development serves as a blueprint to explore human cell fate determination.},

  abstract = {The vertebrate neural tube generates a large diversity of molecularly and functionally distinct neurons and glia from a small progenitor pool. While the role of spatial patterning in organising cell fate specification has been extensively studied, temporal patterning, which controls the timing of cell type generation, is equally important. Here we define a global temporal programme operating in progenitors throughout the vertebrate nervous systems that governs cell fate choices by regulating chromatin accessibility. Perturbation of this cis-regulatory programme affects sequential cell fate transitions in neural progenitors and the identity of their progeny. The temporal programme operates in parallel to spatial patterning, ensuring the timely availability of regulatory elements for spatial determinants to direct cell-type specific gene expression. These findings identify a chronotopic spatiotemporal integration strategy in which a global temporal chromatin programme determines the output of a spatial gene regulatory network resulting in the temporally and spatially ordered allocation of cell type identity.},
